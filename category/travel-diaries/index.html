		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The week had passed by surprisingly fast. We were on the last (or second-last) day of our trip. There was still uncertainty around whether we wanted or would be able to ride the 500 kilometres to Pune in a single day. All rides so far had been in the range of 200-300 kilometres, although road quality had played a big factor in those decisions. Other than the 150 odd kilometres of state highways between Badami and Belgaum, we were looking at excellent surface quality on NH4.</p>
<p>We left at 6:30 am, as soon as daylight was firmly established. Most of the delay was caused due to waiting for the petrol bunk outside Badami to start operations for the day. It probably would have taken longer, given that most of the employees were still dozing. But some persistent honking by a truck and a tempo roused these guys much sooner.</p>
<p>Bike fueled up, we set off. Part of both of us wished to find a restaurant or even a roadside shack to grab a bite at. But the roads were featureless, and pretty empty too at that hour. The only respite were the infrequent hamlets that we periodically encountered. However, the early hour and mild climate helped ease any discomfort. The countryside was beautiful, and though we did not stop frequently, the sights were soothing nevertheless.</p>
<p>The first major halt we made was at Ramdurg, 50 kilometres out of Badami. Poor road surfaces for half the way accounted for most of the hour and a half taken to arrive here. But all was forgotten as we tucked into warm idlis and coffee at an Udipi restaurant.</p>
<p>After breakfast, we headed off again to pass by Torgal a few kilometres away. While historical significance of the <a title="Torgal Fort" href="http://karnatakatravel.blogspot.in/2011/04/torgal-fort.html">fort at Torgal</a> evades me today, some pre-tour research had indicated that it was a relatively well-preserved stone-built fort. Protected with two layers of walled bastions, it would have made a daunting fortification in its time. Within the bastions lie several buildings and Torgal village itself. Among the buildings of note are the Bhoothnath Temple and a mosque. The ASI is actively working on restoration and maintenance of this structure.</p>
<p>On any other day, we would have had time to stop and admire this structure. But being pressed for time, and my strong desire to return to Pune by day end meant we had to give it a pass.</p>
<p>The Belgaum-Bagalkot road after Yaragatti again was an excellent surface to ride upon, although scattered patches of heavy vehicles and a ghat in between still ate into a significant amount of time. All said and done, we were in Belgaum only at around 12:00 noon. Meeting Anvith again made taking the longer route completely worthwhile. We chatted over lunch and more ice creams before finally bidding goodbye to him and Belgaum on this trip.</p>
<p>NH4 was a welcome sight after the morning session on narrow state highways. A bunch of other motorcyclists passing in the opposite direction were the only eventful incident that occurred until Nippani, where we stopped for our first breather. Our seats were getting uncomfortable now and the sun was stinging. We soldiered on after a bit of stretching, and managed to get up to Kolhapur without any pauses.</p>
<p>The short shadows from the time of leaving Belgaum had elongated a bit by now. Hunger and thirst forced us to stop here, and the cool environs of a local cafe kept us comfortable for an hour or so. Their soft sofa cushions were a welcome relief from an entire day astride the motorcycle saddle. At 4 pm, we reluctantly left the cafe and began the rest of the ride.</p>
<p>Beleaguered by the relatively bad road quality in Maharashtra and fatigue from riding all day, progress was very slow, although our averages were still quite great due to excellent riding in the morning and afternoon sessions. We reached Surur at 5:00 pm and stopped for food and water. Ami was close to passing out from the sun by now. Rest and food helped restore some sanity, but she remained quiet for the time that we were stopped.</p>
<p>We left from Surur at 5:40 pm, with about 45 minutes of daylight left. I intended to make the most of this time by covering the distance up to Shirwal at the least. We were a little ahead at Kapurhol when the sun finally sank behind the hills over the horizon. We continued to make good time for the remaining half an hour of natural light, managing to cross the toll booth near Khed-Shivapur.</p>
<p>From here onward we took it easy as darkness had set. It was 7:30 pm when we finally got off the highway at Sinhagadh Road. We stopped for dinner along the way within the city, before reaching home exhausted but happy at well past 10 in the night.</p>
<p>It had been a long day.</p>

		<p>We left at 7:00 am from the hotel after a disappointing breakfast of upma and sheera. The bright light and clear air lifted our spirits along the way. A particularly beautiful stretch of shady gulmohars caught our attention and begged for a photo session. After idling away for twenty minutes or so under the trees, we moved on further to Pattadakal.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattadakal">Pattadakal</a> is a tiny village, about 20 kilometres from Badami, situated on the banks of the Malaprabha river. Its primary attraction are its historic temples from approximately the 7th and 8th centuries, most of which are located inside a UNESCO World Heritage site complex. A solitary Jain temple is located some kilometres away, but built in what looked like similar style. Pattadakal has the unique distinction of being the only spot where temples were built in both, Dravidian and Nagara styles of architecture. After the Chalukya capital was moved here from Badami, royal coronations of the kings were held at the Virupaksha Temple at this site. The road from Badami to Pattadakal is prime back-country. You&#8217;ll probably see more goats than humans en route.</p>
<p>By the time we reached here, tt was later in the day than I might have liked. But irrespective of that, the light was still tender and the place not crowded. We took our time to idly browse through the exquisitely carved monuments.</p>
<p>Close to three hours later, when we were finally packing up, the crowds began to flow in. Being holiday season in India, most visitors were families, although we did see some of what looked like college or senior school class groups. The heat had begun to sting by then. We were both unwilling to suffer our way to Aihole in this weather. And by now, I was pretty sick of seeing stone temples. Concrete is where it is.</p>
<p>We turned back towards Badami, calling an end to our sightseeing activities on this trip.</p>
<p>The evening was spent with a leisurely walk through the Badami bazar, ending with idlis and dosas at Geeta Darshini restaurant. This place is not exactly the epitome of hygeine and quality, but the food was surprisingly much better than what we had at any of the star-rated resorts at Badami. Travel continues to surprise me. An early lights out ended the day by 8:00 pm.</p>

		<p>The KSTDC website mentioned Badami as the capital in the early days of the Chalukya dynasty. It was founded in the 6th century and remained as the seat of power up to the 8th. Its primary attractions are the cave temples, which are excavated out of solid rock. But the nearby sites of Pattadakal and Aihole are also popular tourist spots.</p>
<p>We left the hotel room at Hospet at 7:00 am and stopped at a darshini along the way for breakfast. Hot idlis, washed down with excellent filter coffee primed the mood for the day&#8217;s riding. At 150 kilometres away, we were confident of reaching Badami by lunchtime. But first we would have to tackle 20 kilometres of bad roads through Hospet town itself and the rest through the highways outside municipality limits. We managed to tackle this in good time due to the early hour and light traffic, and were soon staring at a signboard pointing towards NH 13 and Kushtagi.</p>
<p>Repair work on NH 13 is nearing completion, but it has its share of detours and rough patches yet. Road work ends at around Budugumpa, where we had to take the bike from below the support scaffolding of an under-construction flyover. It&#8217;s all smooth sailing afterwards. However, the bare, featureless landscape made for some really boring riding. We had to fall back upon the all time favourite &#8211; antakshari &#8211; to keep ourselves awake and interested. Singing on a motorcycle is a surefire way to run your voice hoarse. Sudden gusts on strong westerly crosswinds helped break the boredom once in a while. In all, while my original estimate to reach Kushtagi from Hospet had been one hour, it was closer to two hours later that we finally reached the town.</p>
<p>After Kushtagi, the going became much simpler. The state highway was narrower, but had thick tree cover or other wind-breakers. Whatever was left of the wind would come as headwinds, which did not affect handling much. Clear weather and decent road quality helped make good time all the way to Badami.</p>
<p>At Badami, the hotel was a non-descript guesthouse converted out of an old stone bungalow. Being run by the state tourism department, the facilities were predictably average. The air-conditioner worked, but gaps in the vintage door and window frames ensured the room did not turn too cold. The television worked, serving up every possible Kannada language channel being broadcast, with a smattering of Hindi and English thrown in between. Tossing out a couple of lizards added some excitement to an otherwise boring afternoon. The dal fry and rice we had for lunch at the hotel restaurant was palatable.</p>
<p>We rode out to the Badami Caves late in the afternoon. As far as distances go, Badami isn&#8217;t much. And well positioned signs guide the tourist to all places of interest without trouble. Side roads are rubble, littered with flowing garbage, and infested with pigs who dart across with surprising agility. Be careful around them. The caves were nice as far as monuments went, but were completely littered with all varieties of smart alecs out to fleece visitors. One group of stags, obviously smelling of alcohol, tried to make a strong bid at &#8216;fraanship&#8217; with us. They would continue to follow us out of the caves complex and cause a slight change in plans later in the evening.</p>
<p>The caves themselves obviously impressive, but it is obvious that artistic skill and architectural technology had increased substantially in later years, as is evident at Lakkundi and Hampi. The carvings are not quite as finely made or interestingly laid out. Nevertheless, the breathtaking views of Badami, Bhoothnath Temple and Agastya Lake from that altitude made the trip worthwhile.</p>
<p>As we left the parking lot, I noticed a white car following us in undue hurry. I slowed down under the pretext of navigating around a pig and saw that it was the same guys that were trying to get friendly at the caves. We were now on the road towards Banashankari Temples over SH 57, backtracing the same road we had followed yesterday. Not wanting to be harassed by these guys any more, I let them pass ahead once we reached the parking lot, then continued ahead instead of stopping. It would have been nice to sit at the banks of the tank, but that was not to be.</p>
<p>We turned left at the next junction on the road to the back country roads nearby. It was 6:00 in the evening and the weather was pleasant. The landscape was very rustic, with mud-built houses along the way, shepherds taking their flocks home and the evening calls of birds rending in the air. We stopped for a bit at a bridge to take in the sights of flowing waters before heading back to Badami. Unknown to us, the route we took rounded off back to the Banashankari Temple parking lot. But by the time we reached there, the car following us was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Dinner at the Heritage Resort had a wider range of options than the lunch at Mayura Chalukya. We made short work of it before heading back to the hotel. There&#8217;s little to do in Badami in the evenings. If you&#8217;re planning to visit, either get a large group together or carry plenty of board games with you.</p>

<p>Having spent the first day getting familiar with the site, I was a lot more confident now of being able to do some justice to the royal enclosure without the aid of a guide. We had to spend time waiting for Mango Tree, the restaurant from the evening before, to open up for breakfast before we could go ahead. The food there was so nice that we were now unwilling to take risks elsewhere. After pancakes and grilled sandwiches, all washed down with hot chocolate, we were ready for the day&#8217;s adventures.</p>
<div id="attachment_342" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/krishna-temple/" rel="attachment wp-att-342"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-342" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/krishna-temple-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="At the Krishna Temple" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-342" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-342" class="wp-caption-text">At the Krishna Temple</p></div>
<p>Unlike at the religious centre, vehicles can be driven into the royal enclosure. In fact, this is the recommended way of exploring here, simply because of the distances between different sites. They usually lie at least 2-3 kilometres away from each other. Add up the walking required within their premises and possibly going back and forth for meals, and you&#8217;re looking at an ungodly figure which causes a lot of wasted time by the end of the day. Even a bicycle is better than walking.</p>

<p>This circuit covers the Krishna Temple, Ugra Narsimha idol, underground Shiva Temple, Hazara Rama Temple, the zenana complex, elephant stables and several other sites. The ASI museum also falls on this same route, although we did not have time to visit.</p>
<h3>The Morning Session</h3>
<p>We started off with the <a href="http://hampi.in/krishna-temple">Krishna Temple</a>, which takes at least an hour for a casual look around. While the complex is not all that large as such, it has several structures and some well-preserved relief sculptures which immediately catch the eye. For those with an eye for detail and the time to spare, this site itself can consume several hours.</p>
<div id="attachment_343" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/krishna-temple-dasha-avatar/" rel="attachment wp-att-343"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/krishna-temple-dasha-avatar-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="Dasha Avatar reliefs at the temple gates" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-343" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-343" class="wp-caption-text">Dasha Avatar reliefs at the temple gates</p></div>
<p>Krishnadevaraya commissioned construction in the 16th century to celebrate his victory over the kingdom of Utkala in present-day Orissa. The original idol of Balakrishna has been relocated to the state museum in Chennai. The main structure as well as accompanying shrines and pillared halls are all beautifully carved, partly due to the temples relatively recent vintage. Some things to note are the figures of Yalis on the pillars of the main structure, and the reliefs of the 10 avatars of Vishnu at the main gate.</p>
<p>The underground Shiva Temple, up next in the route map, was a bit of a downer due to lack of maintenance and the resultant flooding of the interiors. Architecturally too, this place is nothing particularly substantial to speak of. It is a convenient location to waste away hot afternoons due to its cooler temperatures and surrounding gardens. Bring a food basket and a mat to make a picnic out of it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_345" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/pillar-of-exquisite-beauty/" rel="attachment wp-att-345"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-345" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/pillar-of-exquisite-beauty-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="Tourists strike a pose inside the mukhmantapa at the Hazara Rama Temple" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-345" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-345" class="wp-caption-text">Tourists strike a pose inside the mukhmantapa at the Hazara Rama Temple</p></div><br />
Another location great for hiding out from the sun and heat is the mosque, just a short distance away from the underground Shiva Temple. This is actually a large complex with several structures including a watch tower, a band tower and a mosque. We sat under the shade in the mosque for a while to catch some relief from the heat before moving on to the <a href="http://hampi.in/hazara-rama-temple">Hazara Rama Temple</a>.</p>
<p>This is easily one of the nicest and best-preserved sites here, on par with the Krishna Temple. This temple is popular for the carved reliefs of the Ramayana on its walls. While this site is not as large as any of the other temple complexes in Hampi, its importance is greatly elevated due to its central location in the royal enclosure. Historians believe that this temple was used as a private shrine for the king and the royal family.</p>
<div id="attachment_339" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/hazara-rama-temple/" rel="attachment wp-att-339"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-339" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/hazara-rama-temple-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="At the Hazara Rama Temple" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-339" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-339" class="wp-caption-text">At the Hazara Rama Temple<br /></p></div>
<p>A small open-air museum and merchandise store lies at the ASI office nearby. The artifacts and idols here are worth looking at, in spite of the apparent lack of visitors. Also of note is the photo museum where you can see prints of original works by Alexandar Greenlaw and John Gollings. Greenlaw was a member of the British army with an interest in surveying and documenting the regions of the empire. He was part of the earliest efforts of the British to establish an archeological survey department in India. His photographs, lost for many years, were discovered in 1980 in a private collection. His waxed paper negatives provide an insight into the earliest records of discovery and excavation at Hampi. Replicating his photographs with modern technology is a popular activity for many visitors today.</p>
<div id="attachment_344" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/maha-mantapa/" rel="attachment wp-att-344"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/maha-mantapa-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="Musical pillars at the Vittala Temple" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-344" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-344" class="wp-caption-text">The main hall of the Vittala Temple, reknowned for its musical pillars</p></div>
<p>We covered them up to the elephant stables before returning back to Mango Tree for lunch (yes, it was <em>that</em> good). After whiling away the worst of the afternoon under its shady interiors, we rode back to the Vittala Temple to do better justice to it in the soft evening light.</p>
<p>Vittala Temple is a lot more easily accessible from the royal enclosure side. You can park your vehicle at the parking lot and either walk the 2 kilometres to the temple, or take an electric car which charges Rs. 20 for a to-and-fro ticket. Walking gives you the option of stopping at Pushkarni, a stepped tank which lies close to the Vittala Temple. We chose to take the car because of the crazy heat. The weather only began to get more tolerable after 5:30 pm while we were in the temple premises.</p>
<p>The day ended with an early ride back to the hotel, mediocre but convenient hotel room service dinner and an early lights-out in preparation for the ride to Badami the next day.</p>
<div id="attachment_346" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/riding-through-hampi/" rel="attachment wp-att-346"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-346" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/riding-through-hampi-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="In between sites" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-346" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-346" class="wp-caption-text">Riding through the dusty roads between sites<br /></p></div>
<h4>Final Impressions</h4>
<p>While we did visit Hampi in this trip, I cannot rightly say that we have done it justice. Two days is barely enough to get familiar with the layout. I could spend a week here before beginning to get bored. If you are a history buff, you could probably spend even more time. Adventure seekers too come here frequently to climb the unending expanses of rocky boulders and hills. And there&#8217;s something for all levels of difficulty – from straight out steps cut into the rock, to flat-faced ledges that require strength and skill to scale. The third interesting activity is to ride out into the countryside and just soak in the sights. Natural surroundings and a variety of avian population can guarantee a fun ride. The nearby bear sanctuary also sounds promising, although we didn&#8217;t have the time to visit.</p>
<div id="attachment_348" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/sun-temple/" rel="attachment wp-att-348"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-348" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sun-temple.jpg" alt="" title="The stone chariot, a shrine to Garuda, at the Vittala Temple" width="800" height="600" class="size-full wp-image-348" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-348" class="wp-caption-text">The stone chariot, a shrine to Garuda, at the Vittala Temple</p></div>
<p>Either my expectations were set to high for the food and accommodation arrangements, or the place really does suck. While Hotel Karthik, where we were put up, had decent reviews online, the actual experience was not quite up to the mark. Especially on the food front, I found the hotel restaurant, Nalpak (promptly rechristened Nalayak by me), to be lacking in quality and variety. Their North Indian fare was boring. And who the hell wants to eat North Indian food while in Southern India? Mango Tree and its cuisine of rich, spicy and aromatic curries and South Indian thalis was evidence that there is more to this cuisine than just idlis and dosas. But most service outlets are unwilling to experiment. There&#8217;s a reason that Mango Tree gets great reviews and frequently returning visitors.</p>

		<div id="attachment_329" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-first-day-at-hampi/sasivekalu-ganapati/" rel="attachment wp-att-329"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-329" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-329 " title="Sasivelaku Ganesh" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sasivekalu-ganapati.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-329" class="wp-caption-text">Tours begin under the auspices of Sasivelaku Ganesh</p></div>
<p>At Belgaum, Anvith had mentioned of people having made several visits to Hampi and still discovering something new and interesting to see. The ruins of the old Vijayanagara capital are spread over such a large expanse, that it is impossible to see everything and do it justice in a two-day trip. With settlements dating back to 2000 years ago being found here, this is not surprising at all. The Ramayana too has mentions of Kishkindha, the mythological capital of the monkey kings Vali and Sugriva, and Matanga Hill, both of which are located here. Anjanagiri Hill nearby is supposed to have been the birthplace of Hanuman.</p>
<div id="attachment_332" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-first-day-at-hampi/hemakuta-hill/" rel="attachment wp-att-332"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-332" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-332" title="From the top of Hemakuta Hill" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/hemakuta-hill-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-332" class="wp-caption-text">View of the Krishna Temple and Ganesh Temple from the top of Hemakuta Hill</p></div>
<p>Being on our first trip here, we decided to not expect much by way of sense or structure, and just take things as they come. We hired a guide near the Sasivekalu Ganesh Temple for Rs. 600 for half a day. In hindsight, this was very, very steep, especially considering that April to September is the off season. You&#8217;re better off going all the way up to the tourist information office near the Virupaksha Temple ahead and hiring a guide from there. Do carry a map with you, else buy a cheap guide book (Rs. 20) from the local vendors. They also sell a more expensive (Rs. 100) guide book, purportedly published by the ASI, with much better print quality and colour photographs. But this book has no local map of the ruins themselves. I found this rather pointless since all monuments already have detailed write-ups put up on the sign boards outside. It is recommended to either carry your own map with the points of interest marked, or to buy the cheaper book with the map.</p>
<div id="attachment_330" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-first-day-at-hampi/virupaksha-temple/" rel="attachment wp-att-330"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-330" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-330" title="With the Virupaksha Temple in the distance" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/virupaksha-temple-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-330" class="wp-caption-text">With the Virupaksha Temple in the distance</p></div>
<p>The guides break up the place into two major sections – the religious sites and the royal monuments. Religious sites consist of the Hemakuta Hill, Virupaksha Temple, Hampi Bazar, Matanga Hill, Kodanda Rama Temple, Achyutraya Temple and several other smaller sites, culminating at the <a href="http://hampi.in/vittala-temple">Vittala Temple</a>. If you&#8217;re up for a boat ride, a coracle can take you across the Tungabhadra River to see the Hanuman Temple on Anjanagiri Hill. I declined because of my general dislike for travelling on any surface other than solid ground. Quotes began at Rs. 150 per person, and can go substantially lower depending on your bargaining skills. Make brazen and shameless counter offers.</p>
<div id="attachment_326" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-first-day-at-hampi/anjanagiri-hill/" rel="attachment wp-att-326"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-326" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-326" title="On the banks of the Tungabhadra" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/anjanagiri-hill-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-326" class="wp-caption-text">Living it off on the banks of the Tungabhadra. The Anjanagiri Mountain can be seen in the distance.</p></div>
<p>The royal enclosure falls on the other side of the main approach road to Hampi. This consists of the Krishna Temple, the underground Shiva Temple, Hazara Rama Temple, the Zenana, elephant stables and several other smaller sites. This route also ends at the Vittala Temple, which is pretty much the best preserved of the entire lot of monuments in Hampi. We visited the religious centre on our first day here, covering the entire portion up to the Vittala Temple by foot with the guide.</p>
<p>The convenience of having your own vehicle, especially a small fuel-powered moped or motorcycle, is unmatched. We saw seweral foreign tourists on rental mopeds. Indian visitors generally have their own vehicles or rent autorickshaws. Some walk. I did not see any obviously touristy-looking Indians on rental mopeds, although they are very common with the locals. Cars are fine, but they cannot go into narrow tracks which are common in the religious centre. If you don&#8217;t mind riding in the heat, you can rent a bicycle. We only saw one tourist on a rental bicycle in Hampi for this reason. Autorickshaws are also available if you prefer, but they are expensive. In any case, expect to do a lot of walking. Even with a motor vehicle to travel between different sites, most of the palaces and temple complexes are very large from within. On our first day, we walked from Hemakuta Hill all the way up to the Vittala Temple, back to Hampi Bazar for lunch in the afternoon, and then back again to Vittala Temple to take photographs in the mellow evening light. Then we walked back to the parking lot near Sasivekalu Ganesh Temple, which added up to at least 8-10 kilometres in all.</p>
<div id="attachment_328" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-first-day-at-hampi/purandara-dasa-mandapa/" rel="attachment wp-att-328"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-328" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-328" title="Purandara Dasa Mandapa" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/purandara-dasa-mandapa-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-328" class="wp-caption-text">Whiling away the hot afternoon at the Purandara Dasa Mandapa</p></div>
<h4>Under the Mango Tree</h4>
<p>Food was a big problem the evening before at Hospet. Even at Hampi, lunch was average at best. The evening meal suddenly became much better, due to the chance mention of our guide of a restaurant called Mango Tree. Situated off the main access road, you can see a sign board to the restaurant at a junction half a kilometre from the Sasivekalu Ganesh Temple parking lot. Watch out for a large arch on the right hand side as you ride on your way back. Turn right here and pass through a small village until you reach the end of the road. A downhill slope on the right over paved stones takes you to what seemed like a gated private estate or farm. Cars must be parked outside the gate, but a smaller gate at the side lets bikes inside. Park near the gate and walk a short distance through banana plantations to the restaurant. Built on the banks of the river, the stepped terraces make for a very pleasant and private seating area. While they do serve continental food, their spicy local delicacies are to die for. Especially high on the list are the coconut curry and a variety of ‘parotas’ – a house speciality pie with different types of stuffing such as potatoes, cheese or fruit.</p>
<div id="attachment_327" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-first-day-at-hampi/diet-coke/" rel="attachment wp-att-327"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-327" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-327" title="The Mango Tree Restaurant at Hampi" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/diet-coke.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-327" class="wp-caption-text">Everything tastes better with a Diet Coke</p></div>
<p>The ride back to Hospet was uneventful. The convenience of having a motorcycle was especially evident again, as we rode through the dark night. Had we been in an autorickshaw or hampered by bus schedules, the evening would have been on a much tighter leash.</p>

		<div id="attachment_284" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/fully-loaded/" rel="attachment wp-att-284"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-284" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-284" title="Fully loaded, ready to ride" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fully-loaded.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-284" class="wp-caption-text">Outside the ASI museum at Lakkundi.

<p>Hampi itself is a small village without significant facilities. Most tourist guides recommend staying at Hospet instead, which is about 13 kilometres away, and as an industrial city, offers a significantly improved urban infrastructure than Hampi. Both places fall in the Bellary district of Karnataka state. It lies about 250 kilometres from Belgaum.</p>
<div id="attachment_280" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/belgaum-vidhan-soudha-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-280"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-280" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-280" title="Belgaum Vidhan Soudha" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/belgaum-vidhan-soudha1-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-280" class="wp-caption-text">A closer look at the Belgaum Vidhan Soudha building under construction</p></div>
<p>We left at around 7 am from Belgaum, later by an hour than planned. We were still quite tired and had to yet catch up with sleep. Good roads with little traffic and wind, meant we were able to reach Hubli (100 kilometres) by 9 am. Our original plan consisted of stopping at Kittur to see the fort there. But we had poor reviews from Anvith about the condition of the fort, because of which we preferred to take our chances with the temples at Lakkundi instead. This was a choice we wouldn&#8217;t regret.</p>
<div id="attachment_281" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/brahma-jinalaya/" rel="attachment wp-att-281"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-281" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-281" title="Exteriors of the Brahma Jinalaya Temple" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/brahma-jinalaya-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-281" class="wp-caption-text">Exteriors of the Brahma Jinalaya Temple</p></div>
<p>The road to Hospet diverges from the Bangalore highway after Hubli. Surface conditions are significantly worse on SH 67 than the national highway, along with narrower roads. But sparse traffic and plenty of tree cover to break the wind allowed for good speeds. The only drawback was the complete absence of traveller facilities – food and toilets were both conspicuously absent. By the time we reached Gadag, we were starving and completely drained. I was hoping to find at least a decent restaurant in Gadag, the last major town till Hospet. But nothing worthwhile turned up there either. A lonely dhaba a few kilometres after Gadag turned out to be our last option. The kitchen did not offer anything substantial other than rice, which was palatable, but only barely. It did provide enough sustenance to last until Hospet, at least, which was much more than one could ask out there.</p>
<div id="attachment_282" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/brahma-jinalaya-shikhara-details/" rel="attachment wp-att-282"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-282" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-282" title="Shikhara details at the Brahma Jinalaya" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/brahma-jinalaya-shikhara-details-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-282" class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the shikhara details at the Brahma Jinalaya</p></div>
<p>The kilometres began to melt again until Lakkundi.</p>
<h4>Lakkundi – Big Things in a Small Package</h4>
<p>Most people we spoke to had never heard of Lakkundi, a tiny village between Gadag and Hospet. Archeological resources point out as many as 50 temples, 100 stepped wells and several inscriptions of various vintages within its vicinity. Its insignificant size belies the archeological and cultural significance it holds. Chalukyas and Hoysalas once held this village as part of their empire.</p>
<div id="attachment_283" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/brahma-jinalaya-shikhara-details-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-283"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-283" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-283" title="Close-up of the shikhara details at the Brahma Jinalaya" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/brahma-jinalaya-shikhara-details-2-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-283" class="wp-caption-text">The quality of detail and finish in the Lakkundi temples is significantly greater than the ones at Badami. Due credit should go to the improved skill of the artisans and the better material to work with.</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasivisvesvara_temple,_Lakkundi">Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi</a> is considered a pinnacle of the Kalyani Chalukya architectural style. It is an important link between the early Chalukya style, seen at Badami, and Hoysala architecture who immediately followed the Chalukya empire. One is easily captured right at the doorway itself, by the elaborate nine-layered mouldings of the doorway frame and an intricate carving in relief of Gajalakshmi. Opposite to the main entrace lies a shrine to Surya, the Sun god.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.karnataka.com/gadag/lakkundi-brahma-jinalaya/">Brahma Jinalaya</a> is an interesting temple which was originally consecerated as a <a href="http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/08-09/features1472.htm">Jain basadi</a> by queen Attimabe, wife of a local chieftain called Nagadeva. It is built out of chloric schist, which is more workable for detailed carvings compared to sandstone which was otherwise popular in this region. The difference in intricacy and finishing is noticeable.</p>

<p>According to the description board put up by the ASI outside, the temple was once used to worship a larger idol of an unknown tirthankara. Its name probably originates from either the Brahma idol inside the sanctum, or from the approval the temple received from the Brahmanas of Lokkigundi.</p>
<p>The last site that we had time to visit at Lakkundi was the Nanneswara Temple, just opposite the Kasivisvesvara Temple. It is believed to have been built as a prototype to the much more elaborately detailed Kasivisvesvara Temple.</p>

<h4>To Hospet!</h4>
<p>We spent a good two hours in just these three sites at Lakkundi. If you have time, guide books recommend visiting the Manikeshwara Temple and stepped tank here. Since it was past 3 pm, we preferred to give these two a pass and move onwards. The road continued to remain mostly featureless other than vast open plains and fields until we reached Koppal and Ginigera. The landscape suddenly was strewn with large boulders, a sign that we were nearing Hospet and Hampi.</p>
<div id="attachment_292" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/kasivisvanath-temple-doorway/" rel="attachment wp-att-292"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-292" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-292" title="Doorway at the Kasivisvesvaraya Temple" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/kasivisvanath-temple-doorway-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-292" class="wp-caption-text">Decorative door panels, assembled from nine layers of intricate carvings</p></div>
<p>The road is currently being rebuilt from the junction of SH 67 and NH 13 all the way up to Hospet, which caused a lot of trouble. The dust and uneven surface are the least of worries. One also has to deal with rash driving between laden construction vehicles and frequent detours. To make matters worse, repairs were also ongoing at College Road, a major thoroughfare in the city of Hospet. In all, the last 20 kilometres took us close to an hour to cover. After a week of honing my handling skills on bad roads, I think I might be able to do it much faster.</p>
<div id="attachment_288" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/kasivisvanath-temple-exteriors/" rel="attachment wp-att-288"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-288" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-288" title="Plinth around the Kasivisvesvaraya Temple" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/kasivisvanath-temple-exteriors-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-288" class="wp-caption-text">Rows of elephants, horses and mythical creatures surround the plinth of the temple</p></div>
<p>At Hospet, we were stopped by local traffic police. The officer demanded my license, which was in postal transit from the Maharashtra RTO office at the time of leaving from Pune. I had a reciept in lieu of the licence, which pissed off the officer. He demanded to see the rest of the vehicle documentation, which I promptly presented for inspection. He still seemed to have a grudge about the missing license, but quickly backed out when I offered to call the Maharashtra RTO office to clarify the matter. As suggested by forum members from Bike Nomads, the key is confidence. Having everything else in order also helps. The fear of having to deal with inter-state bureaucracy also probably a big deterrent.</p>

<p>Finding Hotel Karthik was a bit of a problem due to the construction activity on College Road and late hour. And the rooms and food were a bit of a disappointment. Having nothing better to do, we turned in early.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We woke up on time for a change, although we were still quite fatigued by yesterday&#8217;s long ride. Anvith called at 5:15 sharp. He was at the hotel gates. We loaded up some essentials and leftover snacks from the day before, and piled up outside the gates.</p>
<div id="attachment_272" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-riding-around-belgaum/morning-glory/" rel="attachment wp-att-272"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-272" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-272" title="Morning glory" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/morning-glory-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-272" class="wp-caption-text">Morning glory</p></div>
<h4>Part I – Yellurgarh and Nandgad</h4>
<p>We followed him through empty streets of Belgaum until we were out of the city and in the countryside. It didn&#8217;t take long either. While the city roads were quite manageable, the surface turned to hell in the countryside. The Impulse handled it all very well, while the Thunderbird, with its lazy geometry and loaded with the pillion, felt like an ox. We reached Yellurgarh an hour since leaving the hotel room. Thankfully, the last climb up to the fort gates was made up of excellent tarmac. Bad roads were forgiven for the experience of leaning Anna through those curves.</p>
<div id="attachment_270" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-riding-around-belgaum/its-showtime/" rel="attachment wp-att-270"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-270" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-270" title="It's showtime!" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/its-showtime-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-270" class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s showtime!</p></div>
<p>We parked outside the fort gates and hiked the short distance up. The light was good and there was a slight nip in the air. After walking around the rather small premises, we sat down for breakfast in the morning light. Anvith played the perfect host, fishing out coffee, bread, jam and peanut chutney from his bag. Our contribution of a solitary pack of biscuits looked insignificant in comparison.</p>
<div id="attachment_269" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-riding-around-belgaum/climb-uphill/" rel="attachment wp-att-269"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-269" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-269" title="The road up to Yellurgarh" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/climb-uphill-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-269" class="wp-caption-text">The road up to Yellurgarh</p></div>
<p>After breakfast we headed towards Nandgad, to see the church there. Twelve kilometres of beautifully shaded and well made road melted away in no time. Being early, traffic was sparse and we could even stop for a few photographs along the way. After crossing Nandgad village, the road turned bad again, much worse than what I had to suffer in the morning. The Thunderbird kept slipping in the loose gravel and stones. Target fixation is a bitch. My brain frequently interpreted “<em>Don’t</em> look at that rock!” as “Don’t look at <em>that</em> rock!”. And any rider can guess about what my eyes would be fixed upon. I finally gave up about two hundred metres before the bottom of the climb and parked. Anvith, eager to test out his new off-roader, took it higher up, while we followed on foot.</p>
<div id="attachment_268" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-riding-around-belgaum/belgaum-vidhan-soudha/" rel="attachment wp-att-268"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-268" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-268" title="The new Vidhan Soudha building" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/belgaum-vidhan-soudha-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-268" class="wp-caption-text">The new Vidhan Soudha building under construction in the distance</p></div>
<p>The short climb to the top was only a bit difficult because we were loaded down in the heat by my heavy riding jacket and two helmets. The church itself was pretty unique, dedicated as it was to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stations_of_the_Cross">Way of the Cross</a>. Interestingly, the church also maintains <a href="http://nandgadcross.com">their own website</a>. Climbing down was easier, though the sun still beat down mercilessly. After some dithering for photos and refreshments, we split up back again at Belgaum. We were to meet again at 4 for a ride to Belgaum Fort and lake.</p>
<h4>Part II – Belgaum Fort and Lake</h4>
<p>The rains played spoilsport again by pouring down for exactly an hour at 4. Anvith left from his place when it finally stopped and showed up 10 minutes later and we rode off through the cool evening air to Belgaum Fort.</p>
<div id="attachment_271" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-riding-around-belgaum/stealing-my-thunder/" rel="attachment wp-att-271"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-271" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-271" title="Stealing my Thunder" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/stealing-my-thunder-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-271" class="wp-caption-text">Anvith steals my thunder with his new Impulse</p></div>
<p>The fort has a history stretching back to the 13th century. It&#8217;s earliest construction was undertaken by a king called Jaya Raya. Over the years, it has gone through several extensions and additions under the Rashtrakutas, kings of Vijayanagar (or Hampi), Sultans of Bijapur, Marathas and finally, the British. It is currently controlled by the Belgaum Cantonment Board and houses some wings of the defence forces. It is open to the public, however, due in no small part to the presence of several temples and mosques inside the fort. Being short on time, we only managed to check out the Kamal Basadi Jain temple, dedicated to the twenty second Tirthankara, Neminath. Photography is prohibited inside the fort premises, which is a pity because this temple has some really beautiful architecture.</p>
<p>This was followed by a short walk around the Belgaum Lake nearby. Being late in the evening, we were not able to walk around the entire circumference, which goes as much as 2-3 kilometres. The evening ended with dinner at the restaurant at our hotel, followed by some more ice cream from Aditya&#8217;s. Thanks to Anvith, this leg of the trip went very, very well. While we are culture buffs, it was his incessant chatter and interesting quips that made the trip real fun. We took with us fond memories.</p>

		<p>The night before we were to leave turned out to last longer than I had anticipated, in spite of my best efforts to get things done on time. Work and packing were taking a toll on my already stretched nerves. Which is why when I finally hit the sack at 1 am, I knew there was no way I&#8217;d be getting up on time again to ride out at 6. Being delayed turned out to be a trend through the rest of the journey, one which I would like to avoid in future trips. Morning hours are the best to ride in. Once past 11 am in peak summer, the heat takes a significant toll on strength and sanity.</p>
<div id="attachment_258" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-pune-to-belgaum/smiles-afire/" rel="attachment wp-att-258"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-258" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-258" title="Bright smiles along the way" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/smiles-afire-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-258" class="wp-caption-text">Bright smiles along the way</p></div>
<p>We both staggered out of bed at 7 and stepped out of the house close to two hours later. Strapping down the luggage took a few more minutes before we were out on our greatest adventure yet. It was 8:45 am. We had missed the best time to travel during the day. At this point, I was only interested in reaching Belgaum safe before nightfall.</p>
<p>Being close to peak hours, the traffic had already become thick throughout Pune city limits, in spite of us being on the highway. It thinned out a bit around Katraj flyover and Jhambulwadi lake, before returning with a vengeance after Nasrapur. An accident between a car and a truck around Kapurhol made things worse. The heat was getting to me and I had given up all hope of ever shifting out of the Thunderbird&#8217;s ever versatile gear 3. We too became unwilling participants in a minor bump and graze when some nut on a bike hit us from behind at a toll booth.</p>
<p>After Shirwal, traffic began to thin out again up to the Khambatki ghat climb. There too, most of the traffic was caused by a single multi-axle truck climbing up hill on the narrow incline. Typical of this hour, many cagers were eager to get past the big vehicle and took a lot of needless risks in the process like driving into the rough and boulder-strewn shoulder. Being hesitant to take risks that could result in us turning into road pizza so early in the journey, I took the safer option to trail at a safe distance until cleared to pass by the driver. Roads became empty again until the end of the ghat at the other side. Thankfully most of the cagers turned off at the Surur junction towards Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar.</p>
<div id="attachment_259" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-pune-to-belgaum/contemplative/" rel="attachment wp-att-259"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-259" title="Contemplative" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/contemplative-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-259" class="wp-caption-text">Weighing the risks of getting killed while riding through district Kolhapur</p></div>
<p>We would soon be entering Kolhapur district, which possibly has the worst ratio of dickbag drivers to rational ones in all the destinations we covered through this trip. Even the famed maniac bus drivers from Karnataka would turn white in the face of a white SUV bearing a registration plate with numbers MH-09 searing down towards them. The only physics applicable in district Kolhapur is horse-power. Friction, trajectories and solid body collisions needn&#8217;t be taught in schools, because they don&#8217;t work here any more (until a collision actually occurs, that is). And what&#8217;s with the obsession with white cars?</p>
<p>The road was mostly clear through the next few towns all the way till a petrol pump 30 kms out of Kolhapur. Roads were good enough to let Anna effortlessly pull along at 80. We stopped for lunch and cool off from the heat for a bit here. The worst of the heat was on the wane at around 2:00 pm. But the relief of food and jugs of water was very welcome. We hit the road an hour later, hoping to wing it to Belgaum by 5 pm.</p>
<p>Past Kolhapur, the landscape gave way to much more open spaces and fewer trees and structures to break the wind. Very strong crosswinds slowed us down to speeds of 50 kilometres an hour. The going was tough, but I persisted. This trip was a very important lesson for me in bike handling skills in varied conditions. And my education had begun with a really difficult course. It took an hour to get past the border of Maharashtra and Karnataka into Nipani. The landscape was still open, but the quality of the roads changed dramatically. Whatever problems Karnataka might have, they sure know how to build good surfaces for their major highways.</p>
<div id="attachment_260" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-pune-to-belgaum/nipani-shrine/" rel="attachment wp-att-260"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-260" title="At Nipani" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/nipani-shrine-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-260" class="wp-caption-text">At Nipani</p></div>
<p>Just outside of Nipani, we stopped at a Jain shrine where Ami wanted to visit. While we were there, the clouds burst in a shower of spontanteity. At first I thought it was a light drizzle, but it quickly escalated into a full-blown downpour. We took shelter inside a school building nearby, closed for summer. It rained for more than an hour with visibility dropping down to as little as 200 metres. I wasn&#8217;t keen on riding out in such weather, so we stayed put and idled away the time in banter. While the weather was a downer, time flew in good conversation and jokes.</p>
<p>We mounted up again after the rain slowed down and rode on gingerly through the drizzle and wet roads. The rain had ceased completely a little distance away, although we could see plenty of storm activity in the distance. I rushed through all my mental notes about riding in the rain, especially during electric storms. I was not sure about the risks of sitting on a large metallic object on broad, open roads with the absence of tree cover. It started raining again not long after but we soldiered on this time at slower pace. We were out of the rain again in a few minutes. It continued to pour down intermittently throughout the rest of the ride as we passed in and out of cloud patches. The ride was uneventful after this, with the sole aim now being getting off the highway before darkness set in.</p>
<div id="attachment_261" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-pune-to-belgaum/outside-belgaum/" rel="attachment wp-att-261"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-261" title="Outside Belgaum" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/outside-belgaum-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-261" class="wp-caption-text">A few kilometres outside Belgaum</p></div>
<p>After an hour or so, we finally crossed the Hindalco Club outside Belgaum city. Finding the hotel and checking in was a breeze. Anvith arrived in the evening with his new Impulse. The evening was topped off with plenty of talk with him over delicious ice cream from Aditya&#8217;s, a local dairy brand. Hot topics of discussion were the day&#8217;s ride, his new bike, nearby places of interest, and life in Belgaum in general. Plans were made to meet at 5:30 am the next day for a ride to Yellurgarh fort.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Every trip I&#8217;ve ever undertaken has been formulated around the idea of making the journey the destination. It is the most natural way to travel. Why anybody would want to miss out on the sights between the origin and destination of a journey is beyond me, especially when you consider that a typical vacation requires a significant amount of time to be spent in travelling. But this adage has never rung truer for me than on this tour, where I would be spending many hours of the day at the helm, directing the entire journey.</p>
<div id="attachment_254" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-prologue/you-me-anna/" rel="attachment wp-att-254"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-254" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-254" title="You, me and Anna" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/you-me-anna-800x532.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="532" srcset="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/you-me-anna-800x532.jpg 800w, https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/you-me-anna.jpg 902w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-254" class="wp-caption-text">You, me and Anna, en route to Nandgad – photo credits Anvith K. S.</p></div>
<p>This was a significant milestone for me in many ways. It was my first time travelling long distances in a vehicle of my own over many days. I have done a few trips to nearby destinations, spanning at most a day or so on my bikes before. But nothing ever came close to this one. Being the first person in the family with a personal vehicle in three generations meant there was no resource of childhood road trip experiences to draw from. It was just me planning my own trip, finding my own way and correcting mistakes as they were made.</p>
<p>Finally, motorcycle touring has been on my radar for the longest amount of time. For those who already ride bikes, this needs no explanation. For those who don&#8217;t or are afraid of bikes, the best way to understand the feeling is to mount saddle and hit the road. This is a pure form of travel which really makes the journey come alive. The destination ceases to be a goal as you soak in the experiences along the way. While I have never driven a car, my negligible experience of travelling as a passenger in one was, to put it mildly, meh. I would much rather brave the elements and the dust than travel in antiseptic insulation from the worst that nature can unleash. In my opinion, if you do not reach your destination dusty and soaked in sweat, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.</p>

		<h3>Early Morning</h3>
<p>Being inspired by Sudipto’s ride last Sunday, I had planned my own trip down to Lonavala on Thursday. The plan had to be shelved because we were up till late on Wednesday night following the situation in Mumbai. But I had an itch and it needed scratching. So I realigned my plans for Saturday.</p>
<p>The original idea was to leave early by 5:30 in the morning. Lonavala is just a couple of hours ride from here, so I could be there by early morning, have breakfast and return by around lunchtime. But I overslept instead, and it was 7:00 by the time I was ready to leave. Being late however turned out to be good for me. It had been raining earlier in the morning and riding through the cold rain wouldn’t have been a very pleasant experience.</p>
<p>I donned a jacket to keep out the cold and took off. It was well past daybreak and there was no need for additional lights on the bike. The dynamo on my bike had anyway been damaged earlier and I was not very keen on wasting time attaching the lights from my wife’s bike onto my own. I could feel the nip in the air even as I carried the bike downstairs. The cold air struck my bare legs as I began to ride. Winter’s here, I thought to myself.</p>
<div id="attachment_230" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/ride-to-lions-point/lions-point-climb/" rel="attachment wp-att-230"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-230" title="lions-point-climb" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-climb-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-230" class="wp-caption-text">Climbing up to Lion&#8217;s Point</p></div>
<p>The journey up to Lonavala itself was rather uneventful. I clipped along at a steady 20 km/h and stopped for a bite every hour. It was yet quite cold and the warm missal-pao at 8:30 am provided welcome relief. I was just beyond Vadgaon and just a few kilometres away from Kamshet Ghat. During my previous trips to Lonavala on the Exodus, I had been unable to ride up this incline and had to resort to pushing the bike up. But I was confident that the Navigator would change the equation entirely.</p>
<p>And I wasn’t disappointed. Even more fun was the long slope at the other side of the hump. A light road bike really is a pleasure to ride in such conditions.</p>
<h3>Reaching Lonavala</h3>
<p>Once past Kamshet, the road turns into a very gentle incline towards Lonavala. This had to be the easiest ten kilometres of the trip. A strong crosswind blew from the right, but didn’t hamper progress much. It was chilly and overcast though and there wasn’t even a glimpse of the sun even though it was past 9:00 am. I left the jacket on.</p>
<p>I reached Lonavala exactly at 10:00 in the morning. The odometer read 60 kilometres. The main market of Lonavala had already gone by and I was on the road leading to Bhushi Dam. There was no planned destination in my mind and it seemed quite silly now to just cross the market and come back. This wasn’t exactly a shopping trip.</p>
<p>I munched upon a few biscuits while ruminating upon my further plan of action. Curious passers-by stared or waved at me while I waited at the corner. There were few tourists on this road and the ones who did pass by in their cars cheered or waved past. Hunger satiated, I mounted the bike again and began to ride towards Bhushi Dam. The dam itself is a little off the road and attracts many visitors during the monsoons when it overflows. But this was off-season and it would probably be dry. No other vehicles passed me by till I reached the village near the dam.</p>
<h3>Destination – Lions Point</h3>
<p>Since I had no interest in stopping at Bhushi Dam, I continued to ride further on. There were two navy and air-force installations further down the road so I was expecting some sort of end-of-the-road sign ahead. Surprisingly, no such thing happened. The road branched off towards the navy base a little further, leaving me with more roads to explore. And signs began to welcome me to Amby Valley.</p>
<p>I now had a new destination in mind.</p>
<div id="attachment_232" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/ride-to-lions-point/lions-point-view/" rel="attachment wp-att-232"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-232" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-232" title="lions-point-view" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-view-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-232" class="wp-caption-text">View from the top</p></div>
<p>However, a huge climb lay between the valley and me. Cars and motorbikes zoomed past at several kilometres an hour while I crept along in single digit speeds. I stopped several times to catch my breath before finally giving up and began pushing the bike up till I reached the air-force station at the top of the hill. Once there, I mounted again and began to enjoy the relatively flatter terrain. At one point I noticed a sign indicating a spot called Lion’s Point. I dropped the idea of going all the way into the valley again at the other side and having to face another treacherous climb on the way back and instead aimed to turn back at this spot.</p>
<p>I rolled into a flat open space by the roadside just as the odometer touched 70 kilometres. “Lions Point” – the sign read. The wind was blowing wildly. It was a steep drop from the edge of the cliff. My bicycle and backpack had to be held down to prevent them from taking a leaping dive down. I pushed the bike a little away from the edge behind a locked down handcart and tied it there. I then set off to explore the views and take some pictures of the breathtaking surroundings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/ride-to-lions-point/lions-point-bicycle/" rel="attachment wp-att-229"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-229" title="lions-point-bicycle" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-bicycle-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>There was nothing to hear except the whistling of the winds. Even the chirping of the birds was drowned in this sound. Then all of sudden the wind died down I was startled by a whining sound behind me which turned out to be a dog, probably expecting a treat. But it was scared away when I jumped 3 feet up in the air in surprise.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<h3>The Return Journey</h3>
<p>I picked up my bag and camera and headed back to the bike. It was nearing 1 in the afternoon and I was dying for a bite. The ride down was fascinating and I zipped down in a few minutes. A motorcycle rider headed in the opposite direction was taken aback when he saw me coming down a curve and hollered out. Some of the locals from Bhushi village gathered to wave out from the sides of the road. One of the kids coming from the opposite direction on a bicycle shouted gleefully, “Racing! Racing! Good luck.” I smiled and waved back.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later I was back in Lonavala market, tucking into a meal.</p>
<p>At 2 pm, I began the ride back to Pune. I was now faced with a double whammy – the gentle incline in the road till Kamshet meant I was going to be riding upwards for most of this road. To make things difficult, the crosswinds had changed direction and were now coming on at me from the full-front. My speed dropped down to between 10-12 kilometres an hour and I had to stop for a break every half an hour or so. I was beginning to fear what effort the Kamshet climb would entail.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the winds died down during the uphill at the ghat, but came back double quick on the other side of the hump. The lull in the headwinds had probably been because the mountain itself shielded me from them. I had to stop pedalling on the other side and focus only on keeping the bike straight, such was the force of the winds.</p>
<p>Conditions remained like this for practically the rest of the way up to Bhakti-Shakti Chowk at Nigdi – a full 50 kilometres from the outskirts of Lonavala. The highway was now packed with traffic and motorcycle riders would pass by slowly wondering what kind of crazy creature had been let loose here. Some waved. I finally gave up riding at the outskirts of Nigdi – about a kilometre before the Bhakti-Shakti Chowk and began pushing the bike through the dirt at the side of the road. Not only was I tired, but the two-lane road was getting filled with agitated drivers racing against each other. Several times I saw cars from the opposite side coming into my lane and heading towards me at breathtaking speeds, turning back into their lanes just metres ahead of me.</p>
<p>Once back on a real road, I took upon the bike again with gusto. The buildings surrounding me broke the winds finally and I was able to pick up a decent pace again. It was 15 kilometres from here to home.</p>
<p>I covered the rest of the distance in an hour, mainly slowing down near Kasarwadi due to traffic.</p>
<p>It was 6 by the time I reached home – 11 hours since I left. The odometer read 141 kilometres.</p>
