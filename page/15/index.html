<p>It is no secret that I am a big fan of the Navigator bicycle. Although it is not a top of the line product, it hits a sweet spot between features, comfort and affordability. There are times when I crib about the less than stellar performance of many of its components. But that cribs quickly die down after I consider that better performance would involve unpleasant tasks like spending money.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft"><img decoding="async" width="175" height="175" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/navigator-brakes-175x175.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-240"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cheap-ass local brake levers</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>At the time of purchase I had also hoped it would be less of an attention getter than a Trek or Merida. But I can safely say that is misguided hope because the Navigator is definitely a class better in design, style and finish than other Indian brands and easily sticks out in a crowd. But I still do leave it unattended in public areas at times with just a cable lock to hold it down and thankfully, have always returned to find it as I had left it. I am pretty certain that a Bianchi Aeron or a Merida Crossway left like that on the busy streets of Sadashiv Peth would disappear faster than bank executives after a bailout.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Big Man on a Little Bike and Other Justifications</h3>



<p>It took some time for my interest to deepen in bicycling enough to consider things like fitting. But a chat with Rajesh Nair after a ride around Pune found me fumbling with body measurements and running the numbers through an online fit calculator. A few minutes later, the bearded old man working at the Competitive Cyclist announced his verdict. The Navigator was at least 2 centimetres smaller than what would be an ideal size for me.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/a-bicycle-like-no-other/navigator-rear-shifter/" rel="attachment wp-att-244"><img decoding="async" width="175" height="175" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/navigator-rear-shifter-175x175.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-244"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ultegra rear shifters (can be run indexed or in friction mode)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This explained all the shoulder pain that I had been experiencing after long or fast-paced rides. The upright posture was also inefficient due to increased resistance in windy conditions, and although I was not very certain at that time, there was a gut feeling that the stooped posture on drops would increase pedalling power.</p>



<p>Unlike popular misconception, riding in the drops does not give a person a bad back. On the contrary, riding upright is the problem, as described by Sheldon Brown (all hail!).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When riding a bicycle, the back should be arched, like a bridge, not drooping forward between the hips and the shoulders. If the back is properly arched, bumps will cause it to flex slightly in the direction of a bit more arch; this is harmless. If you ride swaybacked, bumps will cause the back to bow even farther in the forward direction, which can lead to severe lumbar pain. Some back-pain sufferers modify their bicycles with extra-high handlebars so that they can sit bolt upright, with their spines straight. This is actually counterproductive in most cases, because a straight spine has no way to &#8220;give&#8221; when the bike hits bumps. Road irregularities will jam the vertebrae together, often aggravating existing back problems. The bolt-upright posture is comfortable if you&#8217;re sitting stationary on the bike, but is not suitable for riding much faster than a brisk walk. Riders who for some reason require such a position should use some form of suspension&#8230;a sprung saddle at the very least.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lastly, I was missing the bar-ends on my previous bicycle and the multiple grips they offered. They made for more comfortable hands and wrists and were an absolute boon on long rides. It would be nice to have the ability to change grips again after the modification.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Beware! There be Dragons in here.</h3>



<p>It actually makes little sense to put a bike through extensive modifications like changing handlebars. It is expensive, time consuming and opens a wide window of opportunity for unscrupulous dealers to rip you off. If you have a choice between modding an existing bike and buying a new one, it makes more fiscal sense to make a new purchase. But if you are cramped for options or just plain sadistic, let us delve further into the pitfalls.</p>



<p>Purchasing spares in retail is very expensive. And most of the awesome gizmos are not available at local dealers. Which means you will be begging your Ramesh Uncle from Atlanta to bring your bar-end shifters when he returns for his annual homecoming and pray he gets the model numbers right, or else order online and get doorstep delivery.</p>



<p>Each strategy has its pros and cons. Ramesh Uncle might gift your “cycling kit” to you for free, but you have to risk receiving MTB grips instead of shifters because he would not know a shifter if it came and bit his ass. You won’t face that problem with an online purchase, but the associated cost of delivery is going to send the effective cost into the stratosphere, maybe even more than what you paid for the entire bike when you bought it new.</p>



<p>Finally, if the store owner you approach for this modification does not have a conscience, he will gladly lighten your wallet by overcharging you for spares and labour or giving your spurious spares, so your “Shimano” brake levers will last all of 2 weeks or until the first time you press them real hard in an emergency, more in line with typical Chinese-made “Shivamo” products.</p>



<p>So, work hard at learning the mechanics, brand names, model numbers, prices and warranty before even approaching a dealer. Then, when he spouts some bullshit about thumb shifters costing Rs. 1000 apiece, you can call it.</p>

<p>You must study, study and study some more, followed by a written examination and a trial by fire before getting into any such stuff. If you are fortunate enough to have access to more established high-end cycling communities and dealers then you can be exempted from the examination and trial by fire because chances are the service technicians know what they are doing. But since their counterparts in India often believe that the hammer is the solution to all derailleur alignment problems, you need to make up for their knowledge gaps. It helps to be physically present at the store to keep an eye on what shenanigans the bike store employees are up to with your mobile, to lend a hand for some of the simpler tasks and maybe picking up a few pointers along the way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Making Change Happen</h3>



<p>Over several months of reading about a handlebar conversion, the one sentiment that echoed repeatedly was that aero brake levers would not work well with the direct pull brakes on my bike. I kept that information at the back of my mind though, because the dealers I met to consult and cost-compare all assured me that they would make the twain work together like old friends. For what it&#8217;s worth, I&#8217;m still riding that way and happen to find no serious problems so far. But don&#8217;t take my word for it.</p>



<p>I handed the bike over to the care of the mechanics at Surendar Cycles, hoping to pick it up a few days later. There was a bit of a let-down because they were not able to deliver on time because spares could not be sourced easily. The handlebar and bar tape were purchased from Firefox Bikes. I settled for cheap, aero brake levers. And for shifters, I initially had to go with locally made Starlit thumb shifters. These would have been fine, except that they took up prime real estate on the top of the bar, leaving little room for the computer.</p>



<p>I chose the Firefox alloy handlebar over a locally made steel bar to trim weight. It works and there are options in the market at both ends of this one. Cheaper steel bars can do if you are in a pinch, or if you have money to spare, more high end ergo-bars can make for a more comfortable ride. Take your pick.</p>



<p>We also ordered Firefox bar-tape, but it ripped to shreds within the first 2 weeks. I could have easily avoided this expensive mistake by reading some reviews online beforehand. But you can learn from my experience and need not make the same mistake.</p>



<p>Finally, for some unexplained reason, the service folks installed 6-indexed rear shifters for both front and rear derailleurs. As a result, the shifter connected to the front would be highly tensed at the highest setting. A normal rear shifter expects no pull from the cables at its highest setting because they are at their slackest at that point. Because the conditions were now reversed (highest setting, maximum cable pull), the slightest bump or turning the handlebar too much would cause the cable to pull hard on the shifter mechanism and make it jump to a lower setting. This was not an ideal situation to be in and downright dangerous when cornering at high speed on tight turns.</p>



<p>The alternative was to purchase a good set of quality shifters myself. I could not wait for or trust anyone returning from abroad to get the correct shifters for me. I also had a strong dislike for thumb shifters now because they just did not complement the drop bars. After a lot of soul searching, seeking advice on forums and intense meditation on my bank account and the potential impact on my pension portfolio over the next 40 years, I decided to spring for entry level Shimano Ultegra 64 8-speed bar-end shifters.</p>



<p>Evans Cycles has the best deals for these shifters. At £52, and Evans free shipping policy for goods over £50, these were affordable. I threw in Cinelli bar tape for £8 to replace the already worn out Firefox tape and condemned my frugal self to eternal guilt of extravagance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Real Men Don’t Index</h3>



<p>The shifters were delivered exactly a week later. Instead of taking them to Surendar Cycles though, I rode out to Rider Owned Bicycles at Koregaon Park. I had been hearing about them for very long and wanted to try out their service and expertise for a simple project like this one.</p>



<p>The bar-end shifters are special in that they only support friction mode for the front shifter and either indexed or friction shifting for the rear shifter. After a few mismatched shifts in indexed mode, probably because I am still stuck with a 7-speed Tourney cassette, I switched over entirely to friction mode. It seems a bit daunting before you actually try it. But friction mode is really not very different from indexed shifting when performance isn’t high on the priorities. I don’t think I will regret this decision.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>The conversion has been one of the best decisions I made since purchasing the Navigator. The shifters do hike up the purchase price of the bike quite a bit. But the cost is more than repaid with the comfort, looks and performance post conversion. My lower-back and shoulders hurt no more even after a longish ride. I can attribute the first to drooped posture and the second to the increased reach facilitated by the drop bars. I have been taking it out for spins for a month now and hope to send it through a more thorough grind in the next several days.</p>



<p>The shifters did increase the cost of the bike substantially. Looking harder would have uncovered cheaper shifters such as old Suntour&#8217;s. But considering that I was mid-way through a conversion, with my bike completely unusable because of the unreliable performance of the Starlit shifters (due blame on the mechanics for this boo-boo too), I had to rush through the best available option. Bringing all spares together beforehand will ensure a smoother conversion for you.</p>



<p>If LA Sovereign or an add-on provider sold off-the-shelf conversion kits, this task would be much easier. It could probably consist of the drop bar, shifters, brake levers, centre-pull brakes, accessories to go along with these components (cables, hooks, screws, etc.), all priced reasonably. I see no problem in this approach, because with the mudguards and rear-rack that the Navigator comes with, it effectively would convert it into a low-end touring bike. The only other road bike that LA Sovereign has in its line-up is the Urbano, which is more than twice the cost of this bike. But with no facility for mudguards and a rear rack on it, there is hardly any chance of overlapping user requirements. LA Sovereign can continue to target performance bikers with the Urbano while catering to the needs of commuters and tourers with the Navigator and an optional conversion kit.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Early Morning</h3>



<p>Being inspired by Sudipto’s ride last Sunday, I had planned my own trip down to Lonavala on Thursday. The plan had to be shelved because we were up till late on Wednesday night following the situation in Mumbai. But I had an itch and it needed scratching. So I realigned my plans for Saturday.</p>



<p>The original idea was to leave early by 5:30 in the morning. Lonavala is just a couple of hours ride from here, so I could be there by early morning, have breakfast and return by around lunchtime. But I overslept instead, and it was 7:00 by the time I was ready to leave. Being late however turned out to be good for me. It had been raining earlier in the morning and riding through the cold rain wouldn’t have been a very pleasant experience.</p>



<p>I donned a jacket to keep out the cold and took off. It was well past daybreak and there was no need for additional lights on the bike. The dynamo on my bike had anyway been damaged earlier and I was not very keen on wasting time attaching the lights from my wife’s bike onto my own. I could feel the nip in the air even as I carried the bike downstairs. The cold air struck my bare legs as I began to ride. Winter’s here, I thought to myself.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft"><img decoding="async" width="175" height="175" src="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-climb-175x175.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-230"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Climbing up to Lion&#8217;s Point</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The journey up to Lonavala itself was rather uneventful. I clipped along at a steady 20 km/h and stopped for a bite every hour. It was yet quite cold and the warm missal-pao at 8:30 am provided welcome relief. I was just beyond Vadgaon and just a few kilometres away from Kamshet Ghat. During my previous trips to Lonavala on the Exodus, I had been unable to ride up this incline and had to resort to pushing the bike up. But I was confident that the Navigator would change the equation entirely.</p>



<p>And I wasn’t disappointed. Even more fun was the long slope at the other side of the hump. A light road bike really is a pleasure to ride in such conditions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reaching Lonavala</h3>



<p>Once past Kamshet, the road turns into a very gentle incline towards Lonavala. This had to be the easiest ten kilometres of the trip. A strong crosswind blew from the right, but didn’t hamper progress much. It was chilly and overcast though and there wasn’t even a glimpse of the sun even though it was past 9:00 am. I left the jacket on.</p>



<p>I reached Lonavala exactly at 10:00 in the morning. The odometer read 60 kilometres. The main market of Lonavala had already gone by and I was on the road leading to Bhushi Dam. There was no planned destination in my mind and it seemed quite silly now to just cross the market and come back. This wasn’t exactly a shopping trip.</p>



<p>I munched upon a few biscuits while ruminating upon my further plan of action. Curious passers-by stared or waved at me while I waited at the corner. There were few tourists on this road and the ones who did pass by in their cars cheered or waved past. Hunger satiated, I mounted the bike again and began to ride towards Bhushi Dam. The dam itself is a little off the road and attracts many visitors during the monsoons when it overflows. But this was off-season and it would probably be dry. No other vehicles passed me by till I reached the village near the dam.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Destination – Lions Point</h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="422" height="600" src="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-view-422x600.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-232" srcset="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-view-422x600.jpg 422w, https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-view-563x800.jpg 563w, https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-view.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">View from the top</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Since I had no interest in stopping at Bhushi Dam, I continued to ride further on. There were two navy and air-force installations further down the road so I was expecting some sort of end-of-the-road sign ahead. Surprisingly, no such thing happened. The road branched off towards the navy base a little further, leaving me with more roads to explore. And signs began to welcome me to Amby Valley.</p>



<p>I now had a new destination in mind.</p>



<p>However, a huge climb lay between the valley and me. Cars and motorbikes zoomed past at several kilometres an hour while I crept along in single digit speeds. I stopped several times to catch my breath before finally giving up and began pushing the bike up till I reached the air-force station at the top of the hill. Once there, I mounted again and began to enjoy the relatively flatter terrain. At one point I noticed a sign indicating a spot called Lion’s Point. I dropped the idea of going all the way into the valley again at the other side and having to face another treacherous climb on the way back and instead aimed to turn back at this spot.</p>



<p>I rolled into a flat open space by the roadside just as the odometer touched 70 kilometres. “Lions Point” – the sign read. The wind was blowing wildly. It was a steep drop from the edge of the cliff. My bicycle and backpack had to be held down to prevent them from taking a leaping dive down. I pushed the bike a little away from the edge behind a locked down handcart and tied it there. I then set off to explore the views and take some pictures of the breathtaking surroundings.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="532" src="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-bicycle-800x532.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-229" title="lions-point-bicycle" srcset="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-bicycle-800x532.jpg 800w, https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-bicycle.jpg 902w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>There was nothing to hear except the whistling of the winds. Even the chirping of the birds was drowned in this sound. Then all of sudden the wind died down I was startled by a whining sound behind me which turned out to be a dog, probably expecting a treat. But it was scared away when I jumped 3 feet up in the air in surprise.</p>



<p>Jeez.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Return Journey</h3>



<p>I picked up my bag and camera and headed back to the bike. It was nearing 1 in the afternoon and I was dying for a bite. The ride down was fascinating and I zipped down in a few minutes. A motorcycle rider headed in the opposite direction was taken aback when he saw me coming down a curve and hollered out. Some of the locals from Bhushi village gathered to wave out from the sides of the road. One of the kids coming from the opposite direction on a bicycle shouted gleefully, “Racing! Racing! Good luck.” I smiled and waved back.</p>



<p>Twenty minutes later I was back in Lonavala market, tucking into a meal.</p>



<p>At 2 pm, I began the ride back to Pune. I was now faced with a double whammy – the gentle incline in the road till Kamshet meant I was going to be riding upwards for most of this road. To make things difficult, the crosswinds had changed direction and were now coming on at me from the full-front. My speed dropped down to between 10-12 kilometres an hour and I had to stop for a break every half an hour or so. I was beginning to fear what effort the Kamshet climb would entail.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the winds died down during the uphill at the ghat, but came back double quick on the other side of the hump. The lull in the headwinds had probably been because the mountain itself shielded me from them. I had to stop pedalling on the other side and focus only on keeping the bike straight, such was the force of the winds.</p>



<p>Conditions remained like this for practically the rest of the way up to Bhakti-Shakti Chowk at Nigdi – a full 50 kilometres from the outskirts of Lonavala. The highway was now packed with traffic and motorcycle riders would pass by slowly wondering what kind of crazy creature had been let loose here. Some waved. I finally gave up riding at the outskirts of Nigdi – about a kilometre before the Bhakti-Shakti Chowk and began pushing the bike through the dirt at the side of the road. Not only was I tired, but the two-lane road was getting filled with agitated drivers racing against each other. Several times I saw cars from the opposite side coming into my lane and heading towards me at breathtaking speeds, turning back into their lanes just metres ahead of me.</p>



<p>Once back on a real road, I took upon the bike again with gusto. The buildings surrounding me broke the winds finally and I was able to pick up a decent pace again. It was 15 kilometres from here to home.</p>



<p>I covered the rest of the distance in an hour, mainly slowing down near Kasarwadi due to traffic.</p>



<p>It was 6 by the time I reached home – 11 hours since I left. The odometer read 141 kilometres.</p>

<p>C passes variables by value. So if you pass 2 ints x and y to the function square(), it creates a copy of both variables, populates them with the same value as x and y and hands them over to the function to process.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
int square(int x, int y)
{
  return x * y;
}

int main(void)
{
  square(a, b);
}
</pre></div>


<p>The same thing happens with pointers. A char *a points to location 0x000000 (or NULL) in memory. The variable is then passed to a function initString(). Now a copy of the pointer is created, which also points to the value 0x000000 and is processed by the initString() function. Within initString(), new memory is allocated using malloc() to the variable a.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
void initString(char *x)
{
  x = malloc(6 * sizeof(char));
  sprintf(x, &quot;%s&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;);
}

int main(void)
{
  char *a = NULL;
  initString(a);

  printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, a);
}
</pre></div>


<p>Output</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">
(null)
</pre></div>


<p>What happens in this case is that a fresh pointer variable is created, which happens to point at the same location as a, which is initially NULL. Then memory is allocated to this pointer in the initString() function, so it begins to point to the location returned by malloc(). When the function returns, the x variable is destroyed (and the memory allocated to it is now unreferenced, which creates a memory leak). In the meantime, a is still pointing to NULL.</p>



<p>Now let us change the signature of the initString() function.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
void initString(char **x)
{
  *x = malloc(6 * sizeof(char));
  sprintf(*x, &quot;%s&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;);
}

int main(void)
{
  char *a = NULL;

  initString(&amp;a);
  printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, a);
}
</pre></div>


<p>Output</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">
Hello
</pre></div>


<p>In this case, a is still pointing to NULL. However, instead of passing a directly, initString() is handed over a reference to the pointer a – a pointer to a pointer. This causes a pointer variable to be created which points to the memory location of a. Now, the dereference operator (*) can be used to locate the address of a. Thus the memory address returned by malloc() can be assigned to a.</p>



<p>This method is not needed if you have already allocated memory to a char array in the calling function. This is because the pointer parameter in the callee function also refers to the same memory address allocated in the caller function.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick working example that demonstrates the differences between a pointer and a pointer-to-pointer when passed on to a function.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void initString1(char *a)
{
  a = malloc(6 * sizeof(char));
  strcpy(a, &quot;Hello&quot;);
  printf(&quot;initString1():\t%s\t%p\t%p\n&quot;, a, a, &amp;a);
}

void initString2(char **a)
{
  *a = malloc(6 * sizeof(char));
  strcpy(*a, &quot;World&quot;);
  printf(&quot;initString2():\t%s\t%p\t%p\n&quot;, *a, *a, &amp;*a);
}

int main(int argc, int *argv&#91;])
{
  char *b = NULL;

  printf(&quot;Function |\tValue\tPoints to\tAddress\n&quot;, b, b, &amp;b);
  initString1(b);
  //strcpy(b, &quot;World&quot;); // Crashes
  printf(&quot;main() :\t%s\t%p\t%p\n&quot;, b, b, &amp;b);

  initString2(&amp;b);
  strcpy(b, &quot;Hello&quot;);
  printf(&quot;main() :\t%s\t%p\t%p\n&quot;, b, b, &amp;b);

  return 0;
}

<p>At 4:35, I was practically gasping for some fresh air. It had been a long day, and I was in no mood to be cooped up at my desk. Not being able to rein in the bug-list worsened things. I threw in the towel at 4:40. Screw it. Life was calling and I wasn&#8217;t going to let it pass by.</p>



<p>At 4:40 I was on my bike racing away from office. Anywhere! In my mind I planned to visit the new Baner road again, touch Sadanand Hotel and be back in half an hour. It quickly corrected course though and replanned the route to head instead in the opposite direction towards the lush green DRDO estate. This road would lead into the Bombay-Bangalore bypass from where I could merge back into Baner, take in the new road one more time and then return back to work. It would probably take closer to an hour. Ahhh! That&#8217;s better.</p>



<p>20 minutes later I was riding gaily through DRDO, taking in the cool late afternoon clime. I kept an easy pace and did some math in my head about wheel sizes and speeds. But at no time was I missing out on the view though. Necklace Garden was a welcome sight with its beautifully manicured and freshly watered lawns. It ended all too soon though and I had to turn off towards the bypass.</p>



<p>&#8220;Weak bridge. Heavy vehicles not allowed.&#8221;, the sign read. I hoped the Navigator would cut it through and sailed across, right in the middle of the highway.</p>



<p>The road inclined upwards gently past Pashan Lake. The only sound was of the chain whirring and the wheels spinning. Trucks rumbled by occasionally. I was at the top of the incline, just before the Pashankar Showroom &#8211; my favourite spot on this road. I smiled and let the wheels do their thing. What followed was an exhilarating experience of sheer simplicity. The bike picked up pace and was quickly running in the low forties while I held on and enjoyed the thrill.</p>



<p>I was already much feeling much better.</p>



<p>I turned off the bypass into Baner and continued to sit back until the inclines turned northwards again. Even then, I kept an easy pace and enjoyed the warmth of the setting sun behind me.</p>



<p>I was back in my seat exactly an hour later. Nerves soothed, it was back to the grind. But with a smile this time.</p>

<p>God bless America.</p>



<p>We have more American holidays on our company calendar than local ones,&nbsp;probably because most of our business comes from our fair-faced brethren, who&nbsp;would be working over Diwali and Gandhi Jayanti, but probably not on&nbsp;Christmas or in this case, Columbus Day. Since the missus caters to more&nbsp;local demographics and would be working, I had a day to myself to do as I&nbsp;pleased.</p>



<p>Gautam Raja had pointed out earlier that a century ride was a very&nbsp;American concept and hence often assumed to be in miles. This came about&nbsp;during conversation about my previous trip to Khandala-Pargaon when I gloated&nbsp;about completing a century and a half &#8211; 150 kilometers &#8211; in a single day.&nbsp;Missing out the century-mile accomplishment by a very narrow margin really&nbsp;got my goat and I decided to remedy the problem. And I decided to take off&nbsp;again towards Pargaon, and maybe even further towards Panchgini just to prove&nbsp;what a bad-ass rider I was.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Heart of the City</h3>



<p>The route till Panchgini goes well over 60 miles in one direction. In an&nbsp;attempt to reduce the distance a bit I changed it to cut across the city and&nbsp;into Katraj instead of taking the longer route over the Bangalore-Bombay&nbsp;bypass. This was a decision that I was to regret all day.</p>



<p>The National Highway goes through the heart of the city from Shivajinagar,&nbsp;Shanivarwada Fort, Kasba Peth, Budhwar Peth, Shukrawar Peth, Swar Gate and&nbsp;into Katraj. The road varies from rough rubble in Budhwar Peth to concrete&nbsp;stretches at Katraj. I left home at 5:30 in the morning and headed off&nbsp;towards Ganeshkhind Road. There were shorter routes to Shivajinagar but I put&nbsp;safety ahead and took the longer, better lit road instead. For the first time&nbsp;since we moved here I saw the fountains at Bremen Chowk actually functioning&nbsp;and illuminated &#8211; a pleasant side effect of the ongoing Commonwealth Youth&nbsp;Games. The newly installed fountains at University Chowk were also running,&nbsp;although the cops seen the evening before were absent and traffic moved on of&nbsp;its own accord.</p>



<p>I hit the highway at Shivajinagar at about 5:45 and was surprised by the&nbsp;amount of traffic already on the road in spite of the early hour &#8211; mostly&nbsp;rickshaws ferrying travellers to various bus stands across the city.</p>



<p>I really cannot make up my mind about whether the games are good for the&nbsp;city or not.</p>



<p>On one hand, large portions of the city have been given a makeover to cast&nbsp;a good impression upon our foreign guests. For a change, signals are working&nbsp;and even being enforced. And the general presence of so many pretty tourists&nbsp;really does wonders to boost ones morale, especially when you are sporting a&nbsp;sleek conversation-starter bicycle.</p>



<p>On the other hand there is this massive wastage that seems to happen&nbsp;everywhere I go. The Pune Municipal Corporation apparently missed the memo&nbsp;about the ongoing power-crunch affecting Maharashtra. Fountains running late&nbsp;into the night are one thing. But having them running well into the next&nbsp;morning just does not make sense. Especially when you stop to consider that&nbsp;the signals right next to them are promptly switched off from 9 in the night&nbsp;till 8 the next morning. And let us not even talk about the gravy train that&nbsp;the road-repair contractors have been riding upon since the last year.</p>



<p>In the midst of these thoughts I passed the PMC Headquarters and was&nbsp;shocked to see the entire complex lit up with fairy lights. Great! Just&nbsp;great. Entire villages in the state can&#8217;t have a 10 watt light bulb to light&nbsp;up their roads after sundown and these guys were having a party. The freshly&nbsp;cleaned and illuminated fountain at Shanivarwada Fort a little further down&nbsp;the road paled in comparison.</p>



<p>Most people who know me are pretty certain that there is little room in my&nbsp;life for religion and rituals. But there is this bit of faith deep inside me&nbsp;that keeps the flame burning in troubled times. And this faith drew me into a&nbsp;detour into Kasba Peth just outside the Ganpati mandir there. This temple was&nbsp;installed around 1639 by Queen Jijabai Bhosale, the mother of Shivaji and the&nbsp;idol is venerated as the presiding deity of the city. During the annual&nbsp;Ganesh festival, the Kasba Ganapati idol is the first amongst the five&nbsp;&#8220;Manache Ganapati&#8221; of Pune which lead the immersion procession over Laxmi&nbsp;Road. What makes this place special for me is its beautiful wooden&nbsp;construction and serene atmosphere. Stepping over the threshold of this&nbsp;temple is enough to transport a person back into times long gone. It is a&nbsp;great place to hole into while being lost in your thoughts.</p>



<p>This morning though I simply stopped outside the temple doors and shot up&nbsp;a quick prayer. And I was off again.</p>



<p>The rest of the ride was uneventful. Budhwar Peth and Shukrawar Peth&nbsp;looked completely different, devoid as they were of bustling crowds and&nbsp;overwhelming traffic. The sky too had begun to don its mantle of blue by now.&nbsp;But all was yet quiet and only few lights flickered in the closely packed&nbsp;buildings on either side of the narrow road. The only sound was of the chain&nbsp;whirring and the cable lock rattling against the rear rack. I rode on&nbsp;quietly.</p>



<p>The silence disappeared all too suddenly as I found myself surrounded by&nbsp;black fumes and dirty buses at Swar Gate bus stand. The smell of diesel was&nbsp;thick in the air and all I wanted to do was get out double-quick. The traffic&nbsp;too was problematic, made up as it was of errant rickshaws, 6-seaters and&nbsp;unmindful state transport buses. One of those behemoths could run over me in&nbsp;an instant and not even realize it till much later. I flipped the bird at a&nbsp;few drivers then quickly got out of their way.</p>



<p>The traffic died down just as quickly as it started though and I was back&nbsp;onto quiet roads. Thankfully the road widened significantly and had an&nbsp;improved surface. School students and newspaper delivery boys began to&nbsp;crisscross my path on their own bikes. Some looked at me and smiled.</p>



<p>&#8220;Race aahe, race!&#8221; &#8211; It is a race, I heard someone shout.</p>



<p>Obviously, they did not know that the Commonwealth Youth Games did not&nbsp;have a cycling event in their itinerary.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Beyond Familiar Territory</h3>



<p>The road had now begun to climb rapidly. By the time I reached Bharatiya&nbsp;Vidyapeeth, I was huffing away in a low 2nd gear. Banners all over the place&nbsp;welcomed President Pratibha Patil, who had just days ago been given a&nbsp;honorary Doctor of Letters degree by this university, which kind of sucks&nbsp;when compared to former President Kalam&#8217;s degree in aeronautical engineering&nbsp;and 30 honorary doctorates. I love that guy. And I hate this one just as&nbsp;much.</p>



<p>I made it over the slope finally and heaved a sigh of relief. My relief&nbsp;was shortlived though, because the gradient quickly picked up again after the&nbsp;Katraj Bus Stand. To make things worse, the recent monsoons had taken a heavy&nbsp;toll on the road and at that point I would have gladly traded the Navigator&nbsp;for a bike with good shock absorbers instead. Front and rear ones, please. I&nbsp;crawled along uphill in single-digit speeds for about a kilometre before&nbsp;finally giving up and dismounting.</p>



<p>It was around 7 now and the sun was beginning to be seen over the tops of&nbsp;the mountains. There was quite a nip in the air yet, though and everything&nbsp;was wrapped in fog. I glanced over the edge of the road onto the valley below&nbsp;and saw lush green fields interspersed with patches of bright orange flowers.&nbsp;This called for a picture. When I removed my backpack for the camera, I&nbsp;noticed the vapour rising off my own perspiration-soaked back. Crazy!</p>



<p>I was ready to move on after some pictures. The road kept changing fast&nbsp;between good and mediocre and I alternated between riding and pushing. The&nbsp;climb continued to get more intense. Riding in low gear was affecting the&nbsp;stability of the bike too causing me to weave over the road in order to&nbsp;maintain my balance at slow speed. With all the buses and taxis passing by at&nbsp;high-speed, such behaviour was an invitation for trouble.</p>



<p>&#8220;Accident Prone Area&#8221;, the sign read, followed by a steep 180 degree&nbsp;curve. A gaping hole in the guard wall indicated the spot where some unwary&nbsp;driver had ploughed his vehicle off the road into the bushes, or worse, the&nbsp;valley beyond. I was glad that the cycle would never be able to do such&nbsp;damage, but only for a second when it struck me that crossing paths with an&nbsp;over speeding truck probably would leave me much worse off than the wall. I&nbsp;shook off those thoughts from my mind and stopped to take in the breathtaking&nbsp;scenery and some pictures.</p>



<p>The apex of this climb was the Old Katraj Tunnel. I half-rode and&nbsp;half-pushed my way up the steep ghats for the next half hour before reaching&nbsp;the mouth of the tunnel. At a measly 300 metres long, it was a&nbsp;disappointment. The new tunnel on the Bangalore-Bombay bypass is easily a&nbsp;kilometre or so longer than this one. I flicked on the dynamo just to be&nbsp;safe, even though I could clearly see every inch of the road right up to the&nbsp;other end and rolled through quickly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sunshine Highway</h3>



<p>The view at the other side was completely different. The road was very&nbsp;well laid, and outlined clearly by the same orange flowers I had seen earlier&nbsp;in the valley. The sun too had come up higher since my first break on the&nbsp;ghats and the mist had dissipated. The orange from the backlit flowers cast a&nbsp;beautiful shade on the road ahead and all seemed well again.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>I stopped for a few pictures before moving on.</p>



<p>Soon the highway merged into the Bangalore-Bombay bypass. The bike finally&nbsp;was able to pick on some speed on the concrete and half an hour later I had&nbsp;brought my dismal average of 15 km/h at the mouth of the tunnel to a more&nbsp;respectable 19 km/h. My speed on the new road stayed in the early 30&#8217;s&nbsp;through this time.</p>



<p>I halted at 8:00 sharp for breakfast and a quick call to my wife. I was&nbsp;not hungry really, but went ahead and ordered an idli. It was a long day&nbsp;ahead and I would need all the energy I could get. After refilling my water&nbsp;bottles, I hit the road again.</p>



<p>Before leaving, I flicked on the radio and plugged it into one ear. This&nbsp;was to be my companion the rest of the day.</p>



<p>I covered several kilometres over the next hour before the next&nbsp;water-break. It was beginning to get warm now and staying hydrated became a&nbsp;priority.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Whoops!</h3>



<p><em>Sab Sud-Budh-Hosh Gavaa Ke,<br></em><em>Deewani, Main Paagal, Main Jhalli Ho Gayi.<br></em><em>Main Talli, Main Talli, Main Talli Ho Gayi</em></p>



<p>Hard Kaur screeched out of the earphones just as I noticed by bicycle act<br>up.</p>



<p>I noticed a distinct bump with every turn of the wheel. At first I&nbsp;thought it might have to do something with an uneven road surface. When it&nbsp;persisted, I assumed it was a bent rim and stopped to investigate.</p>



<p>Luckily it was only a flat. I was not carrying my patch kit (another&nbsp;decision I would soon regret) but since I had stopped practically next to a&nbsp;bicycle repair shop that was not much of a bother. I was near Narsapur, just&nbsp;a little ahead of the toll booth.</p>



<p>The mechanic quickly patched the tube and I was on my way again. I had&nbsp;lost half an hour but was confident of catching up soon.</p>



<p>The road was undulating, but the bike managed to go at a steady 25-30 km/h&nbsp;throughout. Stopping frequently for water and bananas or a chocolate bar, I&nbsp;managed to keep my energy levels up. In no time at all, I was at Shirwal, the&nbsp;last major town on this route and home to what is probably the only theatre&nbsp;for a radius of 50 kilometres around. Minnisha Lamba looked down adoringly&nbsp;upon my Navigator while Imran Khan pointed his gun threateningly. Sanjay Dutt&nbsp;continued his melancholy stare into emptiness.</p>



<p>The downhill gradient of the road so far now began to tilt upwards again.&nbsp;Khandala was about 5 kilometres away and I would have been able to do it in a&nbsp;few minutes. Then I noticed that my speed seemed incredibly slow. It was&nbsp;taking tremendous effort to go uphill and the bike stopped rolling even when&nbsp;going downhill if I stopped pedalling. This could mean just one thing &#8211; a&nbsp;flat. Again. Yup. Front tyre. And this time there was no mechanic within an&nbsp;arms reach.</p>



<p>There wasn&#8217;t even a hut for 5 kilometres in either direction. So I&nbsp;dismounted again and pushed the rest of the way to Khandala. And being a&nbsp;small village, finding help was difficult. The mechanics on the highway only&nbsp;worked on motor vehicles. I was sent further into the village for help. The&nbsp;first mechanic was shut. The second one was going to take an hour to fix it.&nbsp;The third one was finally able to look at the bike and fix it. The valve had&nbsp;given away and the rubber tube inside it had to be replaced.</p>



<p>But by the time he was done it was 11:30. I had wasted almost 45 minutes&nbsp;because of this flat. It was pretty certain that Panchgini was out of&nbsp;question now. Maybe Wai, but that too was 30 kilometres away.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Beginning of the End</h3>



<p>I crossed another toll booth after Khandala and entered a one-way block of&nbsp;the highway. At first it was a pretty decent road &#8211; shady, well built and&nbsp;mostly flat. Then it began to climb again. The trees also cleared out and&nbsp;gave way to small bushes. And then I saw the first major mountain in my way&nbsp;ahead. So tall, that it made the Katraj Ghat look like a walk in the park.&nbsp;Also more conspicuous was the absence of any kind of human settlement for&nbsp;several miles around. And judging by my recent luck with the flat tyres, it&nbsp;seemed like a bad proposition to enter there. But there was something that&nbsp;kept me going &#8211; the odometer, now tantalizingly close to 80 kilometres. If I&nbsp;turned back and went the exact same route as I had come, I would again miss&nbsp;the 160 kilometres and 100 mile mark narrowly. But it seemed really foolish&nbsp;to go halfway into uninhabited area without any preparation.</p>



<p>While these thoughts ran through my mind, I went past a dhaba, probably&nbsp;the last one on this side of the ghats. I went ahead several metres before&nbsp;deciding to at least have a meal before moving on. It was almost 12:00 noon.</p>



<p>After a greasy paneer palak and 2 rotis I chatted up the owner about road&nbsp;conditions ahead. He pretty much echoed what I had estimated &#8211; uninhabited&nbsp;land, steep climb and rash drivers. At least there wouldn&#8217;t be any oncoming&nbsp;traffic as the road continued to be a one way through the ghats. He told me&nbsp;that since I was on a bicycle I could turn back right there itself and ride&nbsp;against the traffic without any worry from the highway patrols. But on&nbsp;pushing a bit I came to know of another route across an embankment which cut&nbsp;across the fields and connected this side of the highway with its&nbsp;corresponding road going back towards Khandala. I hopped onto my bike and&nbsp;pedalled towards it and hoped to reach the magic 80 kilometre figure&nbsp;somewhere upon this embankment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Homeward Bound</h3>



<p>This was a rough road, yet under construction. But the regular passage of&nbsp;heavy vehicles had flattened it out quite a bit and I was able to make it&nbsp;through with little trouble. The odometer meanwhile climbed painfully slowly&nbsp;towards 80. I reached the other end of the embankment with yet a kilometre&nbsp;and a half to go. Had I ridden the Bangalore-Bombay bypass, I would have&nbsp;completed 75 kilometres at Khandala itself, and would be easily beyond 80&nbsp;kilometres by now. I cursed myself for taking the different route.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/embankment.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-216" width="320" height="240"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Embankment beyond Khandala</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The odometer finally ticked past the 80 kilometre figure a while later,&nbsp;and at least before the toll booth. I began to calculate distances in my&nbsp;head. By my estimates, home was around 75 kilometres from Khandala if I took&nbsp;the Katraj-Warje-Chandni Chowk-DRDO-Aundh route. I would have to modify it&nbsp;slightly, maybe even take a detour through Sanghvi before stopping at home if&nbsp;I was to complete 100 miles.</p>



<p>With this thought in mind I moved ahead.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Misery at 100</h3>



<p>I touched 100 kilometres at 2:00 pm, with the milestones indicating 40&nbsp;kilometres to Pune. This was going to be a close call for me. Unfortunately,&nbsp;I did not have much time to think about this issue. I got off to take a&nbsp;breather and a sip of water. When I noticed that the rear tyre had gone flat&nbsp;again. I was just ahead of Shirwal and luckily, close to a mechanic. The only&nbsp;consolation was that it had happened here and not 20 kilometres back where&nbsp;there was no help available.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="450" height="600" src="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/countryside-450x600.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-215" srcset="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/countryside-450x600.jpg 450w, https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/countryside.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The countryside on NH4</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>I pushed my bike into the village and outside the only &#8220;puncture dukaan&#8221;&nbsp;in the entire hamlet. Locals gathered around to watch this amazing bike as&nbsp;the old man dug out his tools and got to work. The patch from the previous&nbsp;puncture earlier in the morning had given away. This guy tried to peel it off&nbsp;but it was glued to tight. So, this is the best part, he burned it! Liberal&nbsp;amount of adhesive was put onto the old patch and lit up with a match. I&nbsp;watched with bated breath, expecting the entire tube and this guy himself to&nbsp;turn into Wile E. Coyote-style cinder any second. Nothing of that sort happened though, and a few seconds later he doused the flame with a wet rag. The old patch plopped off like an autumn leaf.</p>



<p>The rest of the task was easy. He patched up the tube and I was on my way again.</p>



<p>All that stopping had taken the wind out of my sails. I kept getting&nbsp;paranoid about new punctures and stopped to check my tyres every 20 minutes&nbsp;or so. This greatly affected my progress, although I managed to cover 10&nbsp;kilometres in the next half-hour. I was 30 kilometres from Pune with 110&nbsp;kilometres on the odometer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Desperate Times, Desperate Measures</h3>



<p>The journey was uneventful until the toll booth. My water supply was&nbsp;completely depleted and I munched on the last energy bar that sustained me&nbsp;till Joshi Wadewale on the outskirts of Pune. I refuelled myself on a masala&nbsp;dosa and water and did a distance check.</p>



<p>138 kilometres. 22 more to a century.</p>



<p>In a last desperate attempt, I changed the return route to go over the&nbsp;bypass rather than through Katraj. This would add some precious kilometres to&nbsp;the tally. Going through the new Katraj Tunnel was fun as usual, although the&nbsp;dynamo was not really built to burn at 60 km/h and blew up spectacularly as&nbsp;soon as I reached the other end.</p>



<p>I stopped for a while to catch my breath after the wild ride through the&nbsp;tunnel and to enjoy the view over the Jhambulwadi Road.</p>



<p>The road continued to slope downwards right up to Warje and the odometer&nbsp;ticked on furiously. At the Pashankar Showroom, it was showing 148&nbsp;kilometres, with 2.5 kilometres to Baner and another 10 kilometres from there&nbsp;to home. This was going to be really close.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bug.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-214" width="320" height="240"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bug near Jhambulwadi</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What caught my eye was the tremendous amount of spruce-up that this road&nbsp;had gone through since my last ride. Flags punctuated the road at regular&nbsp;distances, indicating the path to the sports village. The flyover at Sadanand&nbsp;Hotel had been completed &#8211; from a mound of rubble just two weeks ago, it had&nbsp;been converted into a 4-lane, tarred bridge with an underpass for the Baner&nbsp;to Balewadi traffic. Lights, barriers and parking areas had been set up with&nbsp;appropriate signages. And a strong security cover that checked every car&nbsp;headed towards the complex. I think I got away from security only because I&nbsp;resembled an&nbsp;athlete&nbsp;in training with the helmet.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Home Stretch</h3>



<p>Ami finished her work at around 6:30 and called me. Since I was going to&nbsp;be returning by the same route as her commute, I waited for her at along the&nbsp;way. The way back was easy, although traffic did eat into my waning patience.</p>



<p>I finally watched the odometer tick past the 160 kilometre mark near Spicer College, with a kilometre and a half more to spare.</p>



<p>Damn. That felt good.</p>
