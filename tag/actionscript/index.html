		<p>In the first part of this series, I introduced readers to the work reify, which means to make something real. So far, we have seen how the ActionScript application converts a logging request into a command object, serialises it into a byte array, and sends it over a TCP socket connection into the waiting arms of a server. The server for its part must deserialise the byte array back into a command object and execute it.</p>
<p>This last part in the series explains how this is done.</p>
<p>The Story So Far</p>
<p>We have seen how the Puppeteer receives a message. In the receive callback method is a call to deserialise the message into an object.</p>
<pre class="">byte[] message = new byte[messageLength];
Buffer.BlockCopy(buffer, 4, message, 0, messageLength);

ICommand command = Util.Deserialize(message);</pre>
<p>The Deserialize utility method receives only the portion of the message that constitutes the actual data. The first 32 bits are discarded as they are not relevant to the deserialisation process. The Deserialize method is extremely simple.</p>
<pre class="">public static ICommand Deserialize(byte[] message)
{
    Dictionary<byte, Type> instructionClassMap = new Dictionary<byte, Type>() { { 0x02, typeof(Trace) } };

    Type commandType = null;
    ICommand command = null;
    if (instructionClassMap.TryGetValue(message[0], out commandType))
    {
        command = (ICommand)Activator.CreateInstance(commandType, new object[] { message });
    }

    return command;
}</pre>
<p>It reads the first byte from the message which contains the instruction to be executed. The instruction is then used as key to look for the type in the instruction map. The Activator.CreateInstance() API is used to instantiate the type into a variable. The instance is then returned from the function.</p>
<p style="transition: transform 1s ease 0s;">The receive callback then dispatches a CommandReceived event. The application implements the plumbing from that point onward to handle the event notification and act upon it.</p>
<p style="transition: transform 1s ease 0s;">At this point, we need to take a step back and observe the command object instantiation in detail. Each command type has its own implementation detail which interprets and utilises the message. The Trace class, for example, reads the level, category and message values from the message. Its constructor is listed below.</p>
<pre class="">public Trace(byte[] message)
{
    int unixTimeStamp = message[1] << 24 | message[2] << 16 | message[3] << 8 | message[4];
    TimeStamp = Util.UnixTimeStampToDateTime((double)unixTimeStamp);
    int paramCount = message[5] << 24 | message[6] << 16 | message[7] << 8 | message[8];
    parameters = new string[paramCount];
    int index = 9;
    
    for (int i = 0; i << paramCount; i++)
    {
        int length = message[index] << 8 | message[index + 1];
        parameters[i] = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(message, index + 2, length);

        index += (2 + length);
    }

    Level = parameters[0];
    Category = parameters[1];
    Parameters = parameters;
}</pre>
<p>The first byte contains the instruction. This is ignored since we already know that the instruction is Trace (0x02).</p>
<p>The next four bytes contain the timestamp of the message as a 32-bit integer. The value is converted into DateTime object through a utility method.</p>
<p>The next four bytes contain the number of parameters that are passed into the Trace command. The command uses this number to determine the number of string objects to retrieve from the message. Remember that each string object is prefixed by a 16-bit integer that contains the number of characters that make up the string. That's where the index + 2 comes from, which offsets the current position in the array by another 2 bytes. Once the parameters are loaded into an array, they are assigned to public accessors of the Trace class.</p>
<p>The application uses the public members to display the Trace command on screen and store them into a database for persistence.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In <a href="/a-message-in-a-socket-interprocess-communications-by-example/">the previous article in this series</a>, I explained the logging framework that the Flex SDK provides, limitations of the Flash Player at providing effective run-time logging, and how they can be circumvented by using the Socket API. I also described a custom message data structure that encodes the information to be sent out of the Flash Player. This part of the article explores the implementation of the socket server that receives the message, and how it decodes it into meaningful instructions and information.</p>
<h3 style="transition: transform 1s ease 0s;">Introducing…Puppeteer!</h3>
<p>Puppeteer is a desktop application that runs on Windows which can be used to manipulate one or more client applications. The application works by opening up a TCP port for client applications to connect to, then exchanging messages over the connection to send or receive instructions back and forth. Messages are binary-encoded and follow a simple format which was described in the previous article. Instructions are 8-bit integers, and therefore, have an upper limit of 255 possible values. The message may contain an additional payload along with the instruction. There is no limit to the length of the message.</p>
<p>Client applications require to integrate the ability to dispatch, receive and parse messages to Puppeteer. It cannot connect to any application on its own without the application explicitly requesting the connection, and having the ability to dispatch or react to messages from the server. Client applications can be written on any platform that supports TCP sockets.</p>
<p>On startup, Puppeteer begins listening for incoming connections from client applications on a well-known port number. It also accommodates certain idiosyncrasies specific to the Flash Player. Applications written in other languages can ignore these aspects, as they are most likely not relevant to their own ability to function correctly.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Hello!&#8221;</h3>
<p>One of the restrictions applied on the Flash Player is that every TCP socket connection must be explicitly authorised by the owner of that server. To quote Peleus Uhley from the Adobe website &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>One of these features is the ability to create TCP sockets in order to exchange data with servers. From a network administrator&#8217;s point of view, the idea that content from the Internet could make socket connections to internal hosts is scary. This is why Flash Player requires permission from the target host before it will allow content to make the network connection.</p></blockquote>
<p>The policy file is requested automatically by the Flash Player the first time the content playing in makes the connect() API call. The process followed is described below.</p>
<ol>
<li>The content (.swf file playing the the Flash Player) requests a connection to the server through the Socket API.</li>
<li>The Flash Player checks its whitelist if the server has already allowed access to the content.</li>
<li>If it does not already have a policy file for the server in memory, it pauses the connection request from the content and instead tries to connect on port number 843. If a connection is established on this port number, it sends a message containing the string &#8220;&#8221;.</li>
<li>If the server does not respond on port number 843 unti timeout, the Flash Player attempts to connect again on the same port number that is requested by the content.</li>
<li>The server must respond by sending back the contents of the policy file as soon as the connection is accepted. Any other response from the server will be considered invalid and the Flash Player will disconnect from the server.</li>
<li>Once the policy file is served, the Flash Player parses it for correctness and checks if it authorises the content to connect to the server. If the policy file allows the connection, the content is notified about it and is now able to communicate freely with the server.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the first requirement for Puppeteer is to be able to listen for a client request for a socket policy file and serve it up. The application does not listen for incoming policy file requests on port 843. Instead, it responds with the policy file when the client attempts to connect on the public incoming request port number (1337 by default). The response is an XML document encoded as a null-terminated string. The null at the end is necessary. The XML response will be treated invalid without it (many hours were wasted in learning this seemingly insignificant detail).</p>
<h3>A Mirrored Standard for Commands</h3>
<p>Puppeteer works in tandem with the command pattern implemented by its corresponding client library. Each message is serialised into a byte array, which contains the instruction number of the command being invoked, and the payload that accompanies the instruction. It must, therefore, be able to parse and interpret the message, which is done by mirroring the ICommand interface and its implementation classes in .NET.</p>
<pre class="">public interface ICommand
{
    event ExecutionCompletedHandler ExecutionCompleted;

    DateTime TimeStamp
    {
        get;
    }

    void Execute();
}</pre>
<p>The ICommand interface declares the Execute() method, same as the one contained within the ActionScript code. It also declares a public property called TimeStamp and an ExecutionComplete event. A CommandBase class implements this interface and provides the basic common set of methods which are required to fulfill this contract.</p>
<pre class="">public abstract class CommandBase : ICommand
{
    …
}</pre>
<p>Finally, separate classes are written for each command that Puppeteer must be able to interpret and understand.</p>
<pre class="">public class Trace : CommandBase
{
    …
}</pre>
<h3>Insert Plug Here</h3>
<p>The previous article talked about sockets very briefly. So let me explain that topic before proceeding.</p>
<p>Sockets are a software construct that operating systems use to communicate over the network. They are handles to resources over a network interface, same as files are handles to resources on the hard disk. They come in various different types, of which datagram and stream sockets are most commonly heard of. They are often referred to by the protocol they typically use &#8211; UDP for datagram sockets, and TCP for stream sockets. Puppeteer is built on stream sockets. The .NET framework ships with a managed implementation of the socket API in the System.Net.Sockets namespace. The Socket class is the primary actor in this namespace.</p>
<p>On startup, the application begins with instantiating the Socket class, binding it to a local end point and setting it to listen for incoming connection requests.</p>
<pre class="">listener = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);
endPoint = new IPEndPoint(0x0100007F, 1337);
listener.Bind(endPoint);
listener.Listen(0);
listener.BeginAccept(BUFFER_SIZE, new AsyncCallback(AcceptConnection), listener);</pre>
<p>In this example, a stream socket is initialised to use the IPv4 addressing scheme and TCP protocol. In order to begin listening, the socket must be bound to an end point, which is a combination of an IP address and a port number. Every TCP connection can be uniquely identified by its two end points &#8211; one on the host, and the other on the client. The IPEndPoint class represents an end point on one end of the connection. The IP address of the end point is represented as a hexadecimal-encoded, big-endian 64-bit integer.</p>
<p>Note: The IP address of the computer is hard-coded to 127.0.0.1 in this example. There are more sophisticated techniques to identify the IP address of the computer that the application runs on at run-time which are excluded here for brevity.</p>
<p>Listen is a non-blocking API call. The thread continues to run while the socket is listening for incoming connections. For single-threaded applications, the programmer must put the application into a loop while calling BeginAccept() periodically, in order to prevent it from exiting. Since Puppeteer is a Windows Forms application, this is not necessary.</p>
<p>The buffer size parameter of the BeginAccept API specifies the number of bytes that the server has to read from the message sent by the client. The AsyncCallback is a reference to a callback that is fired when an incoming connection request is received. The last parameter is a state object which can be used to pass around the state of the connection. In this case, the Socket instance itself is used as the state object.</p>
<p>The callback contains code to handover the connection from the listener to another Socket instance dedicated to communicating with the client. This is required so that the listener can be freed to continue to listen for incoming requests on from other clients. The EndAccept() API automatically creates a new Socket instance to communicate with the client.</p>
<pre class="">private void AcceptConnection(IAsyncResult result)
{
    Socket listener = (Socket)result.AsyncState;
    Socket clientSocket = listener.EndAccept(result);

    byte[] response = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(SocketPolicy);
    clientSocket.BeginSend(response, 0, response.Length, SocketFlags.None, new AsyncCallback(SendData), clientSocket);
    listener.BeginAccept(new AsyncCallback(AcceptConnection), listener);
}</pre>
<p>Once the connection has been established on the new socket, the server must first publish the string containing the socket policy file required by the Flash Player. It does this with the BeginSend method on the new socket. Finally, the original socket instance which is bound to a well-known port number is set back to accept incoming connection requests.</p>
<p>The .NET framework triggers an AsyncCallback when the data has been sent over the new socket instance. This callback signals the socket to end the sending operation, clears the incoming buffer and sets the socket to begin receiving data when the client sends it.</p>
<pre class="">private void SendData(IAsyncResult result)
{
    Socket clientSocket = (Socket)result.AsyncState;
    clientSocket.EndSend(result);
    Array.Clear(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
    clientSocket.BeginReceive(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE, SocketFlags.None, new AsyncCallback(ReceiveData), clientSocket);
}</pre>
<p>The last stage in this cycle is to receive and process the data, and either respond to the data if required, or set the client socket back into the receiving state as shown here. This is where the meat of the operation occurs. The basic structure of the ReceiveData() method is shown below.</p>
<pre class="">private void ReceiveData(IAsyncResult result)
{
    Socket clientSocket = (Socket)result.AsyncState;

    if (clientSocket.Connected)
    {
        Array.Clear(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        clientSocket.BeginReceive(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE, SocketFlags.None, new AsyncCallback(ReceiveData), clientSocket);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Some basic processing is also performed in this method. The application is aware of the message structure that was described in the previous article in this series. The ReceiveData method receives the entire message, but only processes the first four bytes which contain the total length of the message. The rest of the bytes from the message are read from the buffer into a byte array and passed on to a deserialisation utility class, which converts it into an ICommand instance.</p>
<pre class="">private void ReceiveData(IAsyncResult result)
{
    Socket clientSocket = (Socket)result.AsyncState;

    // Extract the length of the message from the first 4 bytes
    int messageLength = buffer[0] << 24 | buffer[1] << 16 | buffer[2] << 8 | buffer[3];

    // Extract the bytes containing the message and deserialize it into an ICommand object
    byte[] message = new byte[messageLength];
    Buffer.BlockCopy(buffer, 4, message, 0, messageLength);

    ICommand command = Util.Deserialize(message);

    if (clientSocket.Connected)
    {
        Array.Clear(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        clientSocket.BeginReceive(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE, SocketFlags.None, new AsyncCallback(ReceiveData), clientSocket);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Finally, the method triggers a CommandReceived event which other classes in the application subscribe to in order to act upon the command.</p>
<pre class="">private void ReceiveData(IAsyncResult result)
{
    Socket clientSocket = (Socket)result.AsyncState;

    // Extract the length of the message from the first 4 bytes
    int messageLength = buffer[0] << 24 | buffer[1] << 16 | buffer[2] << 8 | buffer[3];

    // Extract the bytes containing the message and deserialize it into an ICommand object
    byte[] message = new byte[messageLength];
    Buffer.BlockCopy(buffer, 4, message, 0, messageLength);

    ICommand command = Util.Deserialize(message);

    if (null == CommandReceived)
    {
        return;
    }

    CommandReceivedEventArgs e = new CommandReceivedEventArgs(command);
    CommandReceived(this, e);

    if (clientSocket.Connected)
    {
        Array.Clear(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        clientSocket.BeginReceive(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE, SocketFlags.None, new AsyncCallback(ReceiveData), clientSocket);
    }
}</pre>
<p>In the next part in this series, I will explain how the command is deserialised and executed by the Puppeteer.</p>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but feel like a luddite as I sat down to write down this article. Who works on Flash applications in 2016 any more? Aren&#8217;t we all done with it now?</p>
<p>The Flash Player might have its own set of problems, which is a topic for another discussion. The ActionScript language, however, is fun to work with. It is syntactically similar to Java, has a class-based inheritance model, a choice between static or dynamic typing, or both, within the same code base, namespaces, and a host of easy to use and powerful APIs for 2D and 3D graphics, network operations, animation, audio processing, XML and text processing, and more. Frameworks like the open source Flex SDK make it possible to do even more interesting things on top of this.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, we are heavily invested into the Flash ecosystem for the VMX platform at Vertika. We have 9 years of effort and 40,000 lines of code written in ActionScript and MXML, which would be very expensive to port over to a new platform without a very compelling business reason. So here we are today.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Flash Platform also comes with its idiosyncrasies, one of which is addressed in this article.</p>
<p>For those losing interest at the mention of Flash, the good thing about this client architecture is that it can easily be ported over to literally any other platform with little change and still work. And the server-side stuff is written in C#. Collectively, this solution covers a plethora of different concepts such as socket programming, data structure design, a custom-built lightweight ORM framework and design patterns.</p>
<h3>Raison D&#8217;être</h3>
<p>The Great Catsby is a rather upset feline. He is fond of company and loves nothing more than to kick back with a saucerful of heavy cream milk and a stack of Calvin &amp; Hobbes comics with his human pals. But they just won&#8217;t let him out of his cage. Catsby, you see, is a 300 kilogram Bengal Tiger at the zoo. And no matter how much he pleads, they are not going to let him out and explore the city.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rather bleak state of affairs for the poor cat.</p>
<p>The guys at Adobe (then Macromedia) had the same ideas when they designed the Flash Player, which was designed primarily as a browser plug-in to play specially authored content served off websites. And as every competent security-minded person knows, it can be a very bad idea to allow strange websites to gain unrestricted access to your computer. Even if every ActionScript programmer pinky-swore not abuse their users&#8217; trust, the guys at Macromedia were not going allow them free rein over the computers running the Flash Player. Hence, Flash content runs in a sandbox with several restrictions, one of them being no direct access the file system.</p>
<p>This is a tough situation for many programmers who need any kind of runtime application logging. No file system access means there is no persistent data storage on the client.</p>
<p>It is not that there&#8217;s no logging at all. The Flash Player Debugger exposes a very limited, plain-text log file access that is disabled by default, and requires a configuration flag in a specific plain-text file in order to be activated. The state of this flag cannot be queried or controlled from within the Flash Player. Extracting the file is a task and a half because it&#8217;s buried deep within the file system hierarchy. The log file is shared among all Flash Player applications which are executed on that computer. While there is no possibility of data conflicts, filtering and extraction of the data that is relevant to your application becomes a challenge. Finally, since this is a plain-text file, there is no structured information storage facility available here other than what can be achieved with plain text files (such as comma-separated values).</p>
<p>Did I mention that even this facility is only available on a special Debugger edition of the Flash Player that most people don’t use?</p>
<p>In effect, it&#8217;s impossible to have any kind of reliable, persistent runtime logging on a production computer. A third-party intervention is essential. And this is the challenge that is addressed in this article – a logging framework that allows Flash content to delegate the task of persistent storage to another process, which runs at a higher privilege level and has access to the file system. The persistence process can be running locally on the same computer, or on another computer. The mechanism works identically as long as the two computers are able to establish a connection with each other over standard sockets.</p>
<h3>Hi! It&#8217;s me, your brother!</h3>
<p>Parents are like the operating system of the family. They spawn child processes, manage resources and schedule time for tasks. A well-organised family is like Unix. Every child gets their own space, and nobody gets into each other&#8217;s way. When they have to communicate, they send messages to pre-designated points. These could be a cell phone, a sticky note on the fridge or a whiteboard in the hallway. They could also speak across the dinner table, but nobody does that in 2016. So that&#8217;s out.</p>
<p>Speaking over the cell phone is more versatile because it works whether the person is at home or away at work, out running an errand, or at a party. A message on a sticky note is only delivered when the person returns back home and checks the fridge.</p>
<p>Operating systems also offer similar means to communicate between processes. You could send a message to the recipient over a socket, or write to a file that the recipient checks periodically. Since we have already discussed earlier that writing to files is out, that leaves us with socket communications.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Flash Player has an API to communicate over TCP sockets. It works identically when communicating with a different device or another process on the same computer where the Flash application is being run. The Flash Player Socket API can only make client-side calls. It cannot listen for connections from another process. Therefore, the external application must play the role of a server and begin listening for connection requests from the Flash Player on a known port number. Once the connection is established, the two processes can send messages back and forth.</p>
<p>This mechanism can be utilised to create an external logging tool that listens for messages from a Flash Player client, and logs them to a persistent storage such as hard disk. Since the socket API works locally as well as remotely, the logging server can be situated at an offsite location, and as long as the two computers can communicate with each other, log messages will be successfully delivered and logged.</p>
<h3>Flex Logging API</h3>
<p>A lot of work that is needed to establish a robust logging API has already been implemented as part of the Flex SDK in form of the Logging API, which is loosely modelled on its Java framework equivalent. This API provides a convenient way to create structured log messages with severity levels and named categories. A log message is triggered by simple API calls, and is printed to a destination by a target object. Targets can be programmed to listen for messages at a certain severity level (and above), as well as certain categories only. For example, low-latency logging such as an in-memory temporary store can be used for diagnostic messages which are triggered more often, while infrequent but critical errors can be dispatched to remote persistent storage.</p>
<p>The SDK ships with two in-built logging targets – LineFormattedTarget and TraceTarget – which provide basic logging facilities to the application. TraceTarget prints the message to the Flash Builder or fdb console and extends LineFormattedTarget.</p>
<p>The Flex Logging API is documented elsewhere in sufficient detail. However, I&#8217;ll cover it briefly in this article to provide context to the reader for how it is used.</p>
<p>The API is centred around four types.</p>
<ol>
<li>mx.logging.Log</li>
<li>mx.logging.ILogger</li>
<li>mx.logging.LogEvent</li>
<li>mx.logging.ILoggingTarget</li>
</ol>
<p>The SDK ships with a mx.logging.AbstractTarget class that implements the ILoggingTarget interface. Developers can extend this class to build their own custom logging target implementations.</p>
<h4>How the Flex Logging API Works</h4>
<p>The ILogger interface provides methods to send messages to one or more targets. The developer doesn&#8217;t create the logger instance directly. Rather, they call upon the getLogger static method of the Log class to retrieve an ILogger implementation instance. The getLogger method takes a string parameter called category, which can be used to filter log messages down to a particular sub-system within an application.</p>
<p>The category is conventionally set to the fully-qualified name of the class that calls the ILogger API.</p>
<p>The ILogger interface also exposes methods to perform log operations at five different severity levels, and a generic log method that takes the severity level as a parameter.</p>
<p>The severity levels in increasing order are DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL.</p>
<pre>var logger:ILogger = Log.getLogger("com.notadesigner.ExpletiveGenerator");
logger.info("Sonofagun!");
logger.log(LogEventLevel.FATAL, "Crumbs!");</pre>
<p>A logging target receives the log message and prints it to the destination medium. The logging target has a property called level, which determines the severity of messages that it will receive.</p>
<pre>var target:ILoggingTarget = new TraceTarget();
target.level = LogEventLevel.INFO;</pre>
<p>The target receives all messages of its assigned severity level and below. For example, the target instance in the example above would be able to receive DEBUG and INFO messages.</p>
<p>A logging target instance also has a filters property of type array that contains the categories which this instance should listen for.</p>
<pre>target.filters = [ "com.notadesigner.ExpletiveGenerator" ]; // Category name must match</pre>
<p>This snippet enables the target to receive all log messages whose category is set to &#8220;com.notadesigner.Example&#8221;. The filters array can contain more than one category.</p>
<pre>target.filters.push("com.notadesigner.GreetingsGenerator");</pre>
<p>The target is actually of greatest interest in this article, because it is this class that performs the message printing. In order to send the message to an external process, we need to build a custom logging target that is able to dispatch messages over a socket.</p>
<h4>com.notadesigner.sockPuppet.SocketTarget</h4>
<p>The SocketTarget class extends AbstractTarget rather than LineFormattedTarget, because the latter merges all the message fields into a single string, which we don&#8217;t want. By keeping them as separate fields of their native types, we get maximum control over the structure of the message, as well as the least amount of memory usage.</p>
<p>We begin by instantiating the class.</p>
<pre>var target:SocketTarget = new SocketTarget("localhost", 1337);</pre>
<p>The constructor takes two parameters for the host name and the port number on which the socket server is already ready and running. We will gloss over the details of performing the connection and maintaining it.</p>
<p>When a message is received, the logging framework triggers the logEvent method of the SocketTarget instance. This is defined as an empty method in the AbstractTarget class that takes a parameter of type LogEvent. By overriding this method, the SocketTarget instance can then dispatch the message to the server.</p>
<h3>Making It Real</h3>
<p>Before Daryl got into the programming business, he used to wait at the local deli. His job was to take orders from diners and pass them on to the kitchen, and serve the completed order after it was prepared by the kitchen staff. Daryl’s task was simple. He would jot down a list of orders from the table and pass it on to the chef. The chef would then prepare whatever items came up in the queue, and ring up the waiting staff once it was ready. The staff picked the completed order and served it fresh and hot to their patrons.</p>
<p>You want a burger and fries? Sure! Footlong with everything? On its way, sir. Need coffee with extra cream? Here it comes.</p>
<p>The food was good and footfalls were high. The entire team loved their job and did their best to stick to the process because it was so efficient. It abstracted away the underlying complexity of preparing a meal with all its customisations into a simple, mechanical task, while still retaining all necessary details that the kitchen staff would need to build an order.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, Daryl was on his way to become an accomplished software developer of some fame. It was during this period that he learned about design patterns in software engineering and came across the command pattern. In his mind, he could relate immediately.</p>
<blockquote><p>A command is a <em>reified method call</em>. – Bob Nystrom, Game Programming Patterns</p></blockquote>
<p>I find Bob’s explanation to be much more relateable than the longer definition defined in the GOF book. There’s a beauty in its terseness. To understand it, of course you need to understand what reified means. To borrow another quote from Bob’s book</p>
<blockquote><p>“Reify” comes from the Latin “res”, for “thing”, with the English suffix “–fy”. So it basically means “thingify”, which, honestly, would be a more fun word to use.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there we are. The command pattern converts an abstract item like a deli order into a real, fresh, piping hot meal. I’m sure even reading about this makes you hungry. Maybe you would like to repeat the experience right about now, and issue a command to your local delivery joint for a large pizza with Coke. Go ahead. I’ll wait.</p>
<p>Are you back? Let’s continue.</p>
<p>Returning to the task at hand, we are now at a stage in the logging operation where the message is to be dispatched to the socket server process. The Flex framework already provides all the necessary structured information in an event handler – the logEvent method – that is overridden by the SocketTarget class. It is a matter of sending this information to the external process, so that it can be logged to disk. Reify the log, if you please. We need some infrastructure in order to implement this mechanism.</p>
<h4>A Standard for Commands</h4>
<p>The invention of the assembly line provided a massive boost to human progress during the industrial revolution. It was a break from the previous practice of having few master-craftsmen assembling a product from start to finish. By delegating each part of the assembly to a single individual, the human skill required was greatly diminished and productivity soared. Rather than having one exceptionally good worker build a single sword in a day, factories were able to assemble dozens by assigning several average-skilled workers, each handling only one aspect of the assembly process. All workers just followed one instruction – assemble the product. But what each did in response to this instruction was different. Somewhat akin to what we do with the ICommand interface.</p>
<p>This interface unifies all commands so that they can be guaranteed to have a single method for execution. The ActionScript implementation looks like this.</p>
<pre class="">public interface ICommand
{
    function execute():ByteArray;
}</pre>
<p>The obvious follow up is why have a command interface at all when the only operation we need is to trace messages. However, it’s a small leap from where we are now (sending plain-text messages for printing) into communicating more elaborate commands such as enabling and disabling logging, force-flushing the log to disk, clearing the log or sending other structured diagnostic information such as internal data structures. It becomes easier to swap out one command for another, much like the assembly line, if they all must adhere to a common interface. All these commands can be triggered from the Flash application by instantiating an appropriate command class instance, serialising it, and dispatching the result over the connection.</p>
<p>The details of the execution of the command are specific to the command. The common operation is serialisation of the message from a Flash object to something that the server can read. For this, we use a byte-array because it is compact and efficient to send over a socket.</p>
<p>Trace generates a certain kind of layout in the byte array, which contains the string to be traced in the message log. Another possible message might be to toggle the state of the logging operation itself. In this case, the byte array could only require a Boolean value to indicate the toggle state. A more complex diagnostic message might send across complete object instances after serialisation, along with information on how they are to be deserialised again.</p>
<p>While message specifics are different, they all share a common structure called the message header. The header in the current version of this API requires the following elements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Message length (32-bit integer) – The total length of the message in bytes (including the header and all parameters).</li>
<li>Instruction (byte) – An 8-bit integer value that contains the instruction code. Each command has a unique instruction number associated with it. This makes the message more compact than sending the human-readable command name as a string.</li>
<li>Message timestamp in UTC (32-bit integer) – The date and time that the message was created in the Flash Player, encoded as seconds since the UNIX epoch. The time is calculated relative to UTC and must be converted into local time as an additional step by the receiver of the message, if needed.</li>
<li>Number of parameters (32-bit integer) – A count of the number of parameters attached to the message.</li>
</ol>
<p>The instruction for the Trace command is assigned the value 0×02. The byte array needed to trace the string “Hello” at severity level INFO is shown in the table below. Each cell represents 1 byte.</p>
<table class="default" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">

</table>
<p>The first 4 bytes contain the message length. The next 1 byte contains the instruction code (0×02). Four bytes are allocated to sending the timestamp in seconds (1,473,096,753 seconds since 1 January 1970). The next 4 bytes contain the number of parameters attached to this message (3). The contents of the rest of the message are specific to the Trace command. It is made up of 3 data fragments that encode a string prefixed by its length as a 16-bit integer. A string is an array of characters. C-style strings mark the end of the array by placing a null character in the last position of the array. When a piece of code needs to perform any string operation, it walks the length of the array until it arrives at the null terminating character. Alternative to this are length-prefixed strings, or Pascal strings, which prefix the length of the character array at the beginning. Pascal strings do not require a null terminating character as the length of the string is already known beforehand.</p>
<p>This kind of data structure has an advantage of speed over null-terminated strings. Any operation that requires the length of the string can peek into the beginning of the sequence, making it a constant time operation. Finding the length of null terminated strings, on the other hand, is a linear operation because it requires walking the entire byte array to locate the null terminator. Longer strings take more time, shorter strings take less.</p>
<p>The writeUTF method of the ActionScript ByteArray class uses Pascal strings. Programmers do not have a choice in this matter. Therefore, all commands, present as well as new ones in the future, use this same structure to encode strings.</p>
<h3>A Pregnant Pause</h3>
<p>Once the message has been serialised into a byte array, the send method of the Socket class is used to dispatch the message over the network.</p>
<p>At this point, the message is out of the realm of the Flash Player and is crossing boundaries into the .NET runtime. If the server at the other end receives the message in full (which is more or less guaranteed due to the TCP stack), it can be parsed, deserialised and acted upon by the server. If the message fails for any reason, the Socket class raises an error event within the Flash Player for the programmer to handle. For brevity, we ignore that aspect and proceed with the assumption that the message has been received successfully and in full. Transparent to the ActionScript programmer, the server dispatches an ACK response to acknowledge receipt of the message. There is nothing more that the Flash Player has to after this point and it can return back to its steady state.</p>
<p>Keep watching this space for part two of this article that explores receiving the message on the server, interpreting it into its component parts, then acting upon the instruction contained in it.</p>

	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Native extensions are a handy improvement to the AIR ecosystem. There are numerous benefits of being able to to drop into some C code for processor-intensive tasks or extending the Flash API into domains outside of the standard library provided by Adobe.</p>
<p>But anybody who has had to deal with developing their own extensions knows that the packaging process is less than straightforward. It requires maintaining at least two different code trees &#8211; one for the native portion of the extension, and the other for the ActionScript library that glues the client application to the native portion. The two projects have to be compiled separately &#8211; the ActionScript library through the compc tool, and the native portion with its relevant compiler. Finally, both binary outputs have to be packaged into a single ANE file, which is equivalent in structure and function to a SWC.</p>
<p>In addition to all these, the ADT tool which packages the ANE has its own quirks with relative paths (learned at the school of hard knocks), which are best dealt with by placing all the files required for the extension into a single directory rather than scattered across different directories on the hard drive. Which means copying all the various output binaries and XML files into a single directory every time they are changed.</p>
<p>Running all these activities by hand is time consuming and error prone. However, they are mechanical tasks that computers are well-suited to handle. The following batch script is designed for a Windows build chain that compiles both source trees and packages them into an ANE for consumption into the client application.</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the previously generated binaries to begin with a thoroughly clean slate.
<pre class="lang:batch decode:true">del build/*.*

rmdir build /Q</pre>
</li>
<li>Create a new designated build directory. This is the directory where your binaries are copied into and packaged into an ANE.
<pre class="lang:batch decode:true">md build</pre>
</li>
<li>Compile the ActionScript library using the compc tool. It becomes much easier if you pass a flex-config.xml file as a parameter to the tool rather than passing every setting as a parameter to the command line.
<pre class="lang:batch decode:true">compc -load-config bridge/src/flex-config-lib.xml</pre>
</li>
<li>Copy the output SWC into the build directory. Alternatively, the compc tool has an -output parameter that can be used to specify the location and filename of the generated binary.
<pre class="lang:batch decode:true">copy bridge.swc build</pre>
</li>
<li>Extract the library.swf file from the SWC generated in the previous step into the build directory. Unfortunately, Windows does not ship with a native command line utility to extract files from an archive. Alternatives such as 7-zip help fill up that gap.
<pre class="lang:batch decode:true">7z.exe x build/bridge.swc</pre>
</li>
<li>Compile the native code using your compiler toolchain of choice.
<pre class="lang:batch decode:true">MSBuild.exe NativeLibrary/NativeLibrary.vcxproj</pre>
</li>
<li>Copy the native runtime library along with a previously authored descriptor.xml into the build directory.
<pre class="lang:batch decode:true">copy NativeLibrary/Release/NativeLibrary.dll build

copy descriptor.xml build</pre>
</li>
<li>Package all these files into an ANE using the ADT tool. Invoke the ADT command from inside the build directory.
<pre class="lang:batch decode:true">cd build

adt.exe -package -target ane NativeLibrary.ane descriptor.xml -swc bridge.swc -platform Windows-x86 NativeLibrary.dll library.swf</pre>
</li>

		<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="https://notadesigner.com/runtime-shared-libraries-with-plain-actionscript/" rel="bookmark">Runtime Shared Libraries with Plain ActionScript</a></h1>
	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Using RSLs is still a bit of a black art in ActionScript. This is partly due to the fact that documentation on it is sparse, partly because of the complex ActionScript code that mxmlc generates when compiling MXML files, and partly because the process itself is a bit unintuitive. These notes are the result of a few days of research on the topic.</p>
<p>A runtime shared library is simply a SWF file that is loaded into the application at launch. The code and assets in the library are then available for the application to use. This makes it handy when using third-party code libraries, or even your own libraries which are built to a published specification and are not going to change frequently. By making them external to the application, you can also share them between several different applications.</p>
<h3>The Flex Way</h3>
<p>ActionScript developers working with mxmlc directly outside the Flash Builder IDE may be familiar with the following warning.</p>
<pre class="lang:bash">/Projects/rsl-demo/Main.as: Warning: This compilation unit did not have a factoryClass specified in Frame metadata to load the configured runtime shared libraries. To compile without runtime shared libraries either set the -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries option to true or remove the -runtime-shared-libraries option.</pre>
<p>This warning indicates that the programmer may have overlooked the task of loading external libraries at runtime. The Flash Player will throw a runtime exception and halt further execution of the application if attempts are made to execute code which is not yet loaded.</p>
<p>The solution is to add a Frame metatag at the top of the application class and set its factoryClass attribute to point to a class that will be responsible to load external libraries.</p>
<p>If you were to inspect the output of the mxmlc compiler on a Flex application, you will see hard-coded references to all the RSLs that the application is using in the factoryClass designate. These references come from the configuration options passed on to the compiler through either its command-line parameters or the compiler configuration file.</p>
<p>The class that contains these references is usually a child of the mx.managers.SystemManager class and generated automatically by mxmlc. The SystemManager class provides the infrastructure to load these files along with error handling and progress feedback to the user.</p>
<p>This generated class also contains a reference to the entry point class &#8211; the one that extends from the Application class. When all the library files are loaded, the framework instantiates this class and adds it to the display list of the factoryClass designate. This makes the factoryClass the root document class, while the Application-derived class is actually a child of the loader in the display graph.</p>
<p>The programmer still provides the Application-inheriting class as the compiler target. But when the compiler encounters the Frame metatag, it automatically associates the Preloader class with the document root and makes the Application a child of the Preloader.</p>
<h3>An ActionScript Implementation</h3>
<p>When using ActionScript directly instead of the Flex framework, the developer must manually add the Frame metatag to the top of the application entry point class.</p>
<pre class="lang:actionscript">[Frame(factoryClass="Preloader")]
public class Main extends Sprite
{

}</pre>
<h4>The Preloader Class</h4>
<p>The preloading is a straightforward consumption of the flash.display.Loader API. It is implemented here using the Preloader class. This class must fetch every external library file needed by the application. The paths to the libraries are supplied to the Preloader class. When using the Flex framework, the mxmlc compiler bakes in the references to the library files into the code that it generates. The example below also uses the same technique. However, the URLs of library files can also be supplied from any other source such as a web service or external text file. All standard Flash Player APIs are already available to the Preloader class.</p>
<pre class="lang:actionscript">public function Preloader()
{
	var loader:Loader = new Loader();
	loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, this.loader_completeHandler);
	loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, this.loader_ioErrorHandler);
	var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest("math.swf");
	var context:LoaderContext = new LoaderContext(false, ApplicationDomain.currentDomain);
	loader.load(request, context);
}</pre>
<p>It is important to note that the library has to be loaded into the same application domain as the main application. Otherwise, it will not have access to the classes in the library and any attempt to instantiate them will trigger a VerifyError at runtime.</p>
<pre class="lang:bash">VerifyError: Error #1014: Class com.notadesigner.math::IntegerArithmetic could not be found.</pre>
<h4>Using the Runtime Shared Library API</h4>
<p>After the library has been downloaded, the Preloader class instantiates the application class and adds it to the display list. The developer must use the flash.system.getDefinitionByName API to get a reference to the application class. This is necessary because application class contains a reference to the IntegerArithmetic class. If the Preloader references Main directly, the compiler will pick up the complete chain of references and statically link the IntegerArithmetic class into the application SWF. By deferring to reference the application class until runtime, the compiler is prevented from scanning the dependency chain and statically linking the library classes into the application SWF.</p>
<pre class="lang:actionscript">private function loader_completeHandler(event:Event):void
{
	var mainClass:Class = getDefinitionByName("Main") as Class;
	var mainInstance:Main = new mainClass();
	this.addChild(mainInstance);
}</pre>
<p>The Main class then continues with its business as normal. In this case, it is instantiating a type declared in the library and calling its method.</p>
<pre class="lang:actionscript">public function Main()
{
	var integer:IntegerArithmetic = new IntegerArithmetic(); // Type declared in math.swf
	var operand1:int = 10;
	var operand2:int = 10;
	var result:int = integer.add(operand1, operand2);
}</pre>
<h4>Deploying Runtime Shared Libraries</h4>
<p>The confusing bit about using a runtime shared library is realizing that the SWF has to be extracted from the SWC at the time of deploying the application. This was not immediately obvious and I ended up spending days placing a compiled SWC file in various locations and wondering why the application was unable to load it at runtime. An obscure article on the Adobe website made explicit this particular step and set things straight.</p>
<p>Again, when placing the files, standard path rules apply. The Preloader can refer to relative or absolute paths. If the files are on external domains, the Flash Player attempts to fetch a crossdomain policy file before attempting to download the SWF. The policy file is to be specified as an additional value to the -runtime-shared-library-path parameter to mxmlc.</p>

	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I was in school, practically nobody had access to the internet. As a result, every student would have two essential items in his toolkit &#8211; an encyclopedia and a membership to a library. Homework, projects and supplementary studies were highly dependent on both of them.</p>
<p>Encyclopedias ranged from simple one-book units that specialized in a single subject, to multi-volume tomes spanning practically every topic imaginable (or at least deemed allowably imaginable by its publishers) by a school student. In both cases, the research was already done by someone else. When we were assigned a project on the solar system, nobody expected us to discover the planets in it. The planets remained discovered. All we had to do was read about them and share the information when making a presentation to the class.</p>
<h3>Code Libraries</h3>
<p>It is heartening to know that somebody creating computer languages took this to heart and invented the concept of code libraries &#8211; units of code written by people who are really good in the domain, then shared with the also rans who just wanted to implement their business applications without knowing the mathematics of relational databases or the bit-juggling that network libraries perform.</p>
<p>Libraries are compiled separately from the application that ends up eventually using them. They are linked to the application through a process that maps function calls in the application code with function addresses in the library. This process, predictably, is called linking.</p>
<p>Code stored in statically linked libraries is copied into the application executable at compile time, resulting an individual copy being created for every application that uses the library. Static libraries become an integral part of the application that uses them and cannot be shared with other applications. If the library is modified in any manner, the application must be recompiled and relinked with the new version in order to utilize those changes.</p>
<p>Dynamic libraries are stored in a shared location, and are linked to the application at runtime by the operating system or other environment controller such as a virtual machine. The metaphor falls apart a bit when it comes to sharing dynamic libraries &#8211; in a physical library, only one member can borrow a book at a time, whereas any number of programs can concurrently use the code stored in a dynamic library.</p>
<p>With static linking, it is enough to include those parts of the library that are directly and indirectly referenced by the target executable (or target library). With dynamic libraries, the entire library is loaded, as it is not known in advance which functions will be invoked by applications. Whether this advantage is significant in practice depends on the structure of the library.</p>
<p>Other than the obvious benefit of being able to compile units of code separately, either type of libraries offer their own individual benefits also. Statically linked code guarantees that all required code units are present and compatible with the application. Dynamically linked libraries may be of a different version than what the application requires, or not be present at all. Either case either causes a runtime error, or requires defensive code and reduced functionality in the application. Static linking also simplifies product distribution by reducing the number of files to be shipped and installed.</p>
<p>All said and done, both types of libraries are popular and well-worn concepts in computer programming. Many modern languages support either method, usually both.</p>
<h3>Code Libraries in the Flash Ecosystem</h3>
<p>Adobe&#8217;s MXML compiler offers several parameters for programmers to employ libraries &#8211; both static and dynamic &#8211; in their code.</p>
<p>Static linking is almost identical to how it is used in conventional languages. Dynamic linking works slightly differently from Windows&#8217; Dynamically Linked Libraries and Unix&#8217;s Shared Objects due to the browser-based operation of the Flash Player. But these differences are at an implementation level only. The concepts remain the same.</p>
<h4>Static Linking</h4>
<p>To statically link a library into an application, the compiler offers the library-path and include-libraries directives.</p>
<h5>library-path</h5>
<p>When a library is specified using the library-path directive, the compiler includes only those assets and classes that are referenced in the application. For example, if the Math library contains IntegerArithmetic and FloatArithmetic for performing arithmetic operations on two separate numeric data types, but the client application only uses integers, the FloatArithmetic class is excluded from the output. This reduces the file size of the application SWF.</p>
<pre>mxmlc Main.mxml -output=Main.swf -library-path=math.swc</pre>
<h5>include-libraries</h5>
<p>The include-libraries directive packages the entire library, irrespective of what the compiler thinks is used in the application. This comes in handy in a dynamic language like ActionScript because all method calls do not necessarily get tested for linkages by the compiler.</p>
<pre>var classRef:Class = getDefinitionByName("com.notadesigner.math.FloatArithmetic") as Class;
var instance:Object = new classRef();
instance["add"](10.5, 2.5); // Linkage not tested by the compiler</pre>
<p>The include-libraries directive is used like this.</p>
<pre>mxmlc Main.mxml -output=Main.swf -include-libraries=math.swc</pre>
<h5>static-link-runtime-shared-libraries</h5>
<p>This directive is a convenient shortcut to convert runtime shared libraries into static libraries without significant changes to the compiler configuration files. Simply setting its value to true causes the compiler to embed all RSLs into the application. This is a handy way to investigate library-related problems when debugging the application.</p>
<pre>mxml Main.mxml -output=Main.swf -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries=true</pre>
<h4>Dynamic Linking</h4>
<p>A Runtime Shared Library (commonly abbreviated to RSL) is loaded by the application before it begins execution. Loading a RSL is a complicated task if done in plain ActionScript, but is taken care of automatically if the application builds on the Spark or MX Application class.</p>
<p>Adobe-provided framework libraries are the most obvious use case for using RSLs. All Flex-based applications depend upon these files. By caching them after the first time they are downloaded, future applications can be started much faster as they do not need to download the same code again. Custom libraries can also take advantage of the same technique.</p>
<p>Flash libraries are compiled using the compc utility, that ships as part of the Flex SDK. It generates a SWC file which is a compressed archive containing a SWF (named library.swf) and an XML (catalog.xml). To use this library, the developer must manually extract the SWF from the SWC using an archival utility (such as PKZip) and place it where the application can download it at runtime. As a good practice, the SWF is also usually renamed from library.swf to something more meaningful.</p>
<h5>runtime-shared-library-path</h5>
<p>This directive is used to specify the location of RSL files for the compiler. The compiler requires the names of both, the SWC as well as the extracted SWF, separated by a comma.</p>
<pre>mxmlc -o=main.swf -runtime-shared-library-path=libs/math.swc,bin/math.swf Main.mxml</pre>
<h4>Related Directives</h4>
<p>The Flex compiler provides two other directives to externalize the application&#8217;s assets and code fragments. The compiler tests linkages against these assets at compile-time, but leaves them out of the application binary. Libraries that contain these assets or classes are required at runtime, and the Flash Player throws a runtime error if they are not available.</p>
<p>These directives are useful when creating modules which are loaded dynamically into an application that they share code with. The application is linked to the requisite RSL, and the module does not need to fetch it again. However, the compiler still needs to test the linkages against the symbols &#8211; either against the original source code or a compiled binary. These directives assist in that task.</p>
<h5>external-library-path</h5>
<p>The compiler uses SWC files specified at these paths to test linkages with the application code, but does not compile the binaries into the application itself.</p>
<h5>externs</h5>
<p>This directive points to source files containing assets or classes which will be available at runtime. The compiler uses the source files for link testing, but does not compile them into the application binary.</p>

	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the better side-effects of working in memory-managed languages is that you don’t have to bother with manually cleaning up references. This removes a huge chunk of busywork for developers who have one less thing to get their heads around. Allocate an object, use it, and forget about it. The garbage collector will get around to it eventually and clean it out.</p>
<p>What could be simpler?</p>
<h3>Great Power, Great Responsibility</h3>
<p>However, with ActionScript 3, the bar has been raised substantially. This new incarnation adds a slew of APIs that increase its expressiveness and capabilities. Yes siree! ActionScript is no longer a toy language whose primary arsenal is gotoAndPlay(). There’s an extensive library of native classes that can do stuff like drawing on screen, playing audio, fetching text and binary data from all sorts of data sources, or even launching and communicating with other applications.</p>
<p>Take that, Java!</p>
<p>Several of these features mean that its legacy garbage collection techniques have to be replaced with less aggressive methods to identify unused memory. This in turn requires more developer intervention than before to identify which references are no longer required and which ones must be left untouched. The new AS3 garbage collector uses reference counting and mark sweeping (both techniques are covered by Grant Skinner here). And while things are still better than completely manual memory management, building complex or long-running applications requires that the developer have at least a passing understanding of how memory is allocated, references stored, passed around and cleared, and the potential for memory leaks in the midst of all this.</p>
<p>This is where the typical ActionScript programmer stumbles, mainly because people programming in AS3 often do not have a formal background in computer science or programming and have usually learned the language on their own through books or online tutorials. It is not uncommon to find ActionScript developers for whom this is their first taste of programming.</p>
<h3>Our Subject for Today</h3>
<p>One subtle pitfall is the Timer object which is used to run code on a specific time sequence. This class consolidates the setTimeout and setInterval methods. The API is pretty straightforward – create an instance of the class with its delay and repeat count properties, set up listeners which are triggered at the end of each delay or after the number of delays specified by the repeat count are completed, and finally, call the start() method to begin the countdown.</p>
<p>A Timer object is different from other types of objects because the garbage collector does not clear it unless it is stopped, even if there are no active references to it.</p>
<p>Let’s repeat that.</p>
<p><strong>A Timer object is not cleared by the garbage collector as long as it is running, even when its references are set to null or the variable goes out of scope, and it continues to fire TIMER events as long as it is active</strong>.</p>
<p>The only way to clear the object from memory and stop events from being fired is to stop it using the stop() or reset() methods.</p>
<p>The following piece of code illustrates the permanence of Timer objects which haven’t been stopped.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">package 
{
    import flash.display.Sprite;
    import flash.events.Event;
    import flash.events.TimerEvent;
    import flash.utils.Timer;

    public class Main extends Sprite 
    {
        public function Main():void 
        {
             var t:Timer; // Create timer as a local variable

             t = new Timer(1000);
             t.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, this.m_tick);
             t.start(); // Reference ends here; Timer continues to exist and trigger events
        }

        private function m_tick(e:TimerEvent):void
        {
             trace("tick");
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>This may look like a design flaw in the language to the casual passer-by and elicit a very obvious question.</p>
<p>“Everything else is cleared automatically. Why leave behind timers?”</p>
<p>Some thought on the subject will make you realize that the language designers at Adobe weren’t off their rockers after all. This behaviour is by design. In the example code shown above, ‘t’ is a local variable inside the constructor. When the function ends, the variable goes out of scope and<br />
there are no more references to the Timer. If the garbage collector cleared it out, it would not fire any events at all. This would essentially mean that a developer could only assign Timer objects to those variables that remain in scope for as long as it is supposed to run, such as member variables inside a class.</p>
<p>Conversely, a Timer instance which remains active with no way for it to be accessed and stopped is terrible. The object continues to maintain references to listeners and triggers events on them regularly. Listeners can never be garbage collected either because their reference count never goes down to zero. And finally, each active timer occupies a slice of CPU time, bringing the processor down to its knees gradually.</p>
<p>The Timer object always passes a reference to itself in the target property of the TimerEvents it triggers. The listener can use this reference to stop the Timer. When the listener function ends, the event object goes out of scope and is cleared, taking the reference to the Timer object along with it and in turn, making it available for garbage collection.</p>
<p>Here is an example that illustrates how this memory leak can inadvertently occur.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">package 
{
    import flash.events.TimerEvent;
    import flash.utils.Timer;

    public class Slideshow
    {
        private var m_timer:Timer;

        private var m_isActive:Boolean;

        /**
         * Example how not to use a timer
         */
        public function Start():void
        {
             this.m_timer = new Timer(5000); // Create and start a new timer
             this.m_timer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, this.m_next);
             this.m_timer.start();
        }

        private function Pause(e:TimerEvent):void
        {
             this.m_isActive = false;
        }

        private function m_next(e:TimerEvent):void
        {
             if (!this.m_isActive) return;

             // Code to move to next slide
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Slideshow.as</p>
<p>In the example above, the programmer using this slideshow component is expected to call removeChild() to remove it from the stage. However, because the component does not stop the Timer when it is removed, it will continue to fire the TIMER event for as long as the application is run, and also prevent the memory used by the component from being garbage collected by holding a reference to its m_next method. If multiple instances of the slideshow object are created and disposed using removeChild(), their timers will continue to fire and none of the components will actually be cleared from memory.</p>

	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>ActionScript is very well suited to creating old-school demo effects due to its rich drawing API and absence of memory management. Speed would have been a concern a few years ago, but as long as you’re not replicating Heaven7, current releases of Flash player should still be able to handle complex animations with minimal performance problems.</p>
<p>Let me show you a simple wave effect, reminiscing of looking at an object through a wall of water.</p>
<p>Demo effects require a program structure that redraws the entire screen several times every second. The faster the screen refresh, the smoother the resulting animation, at a commensurately higher computation penalty. While traditional languages like C require some kind of a timer mechanism, Flash abstracts away the timers into a frame-rate. We can set up a handler to listen to the ENTER_FRAME event and refresh the screen every time it is triggered.</p>
<p>Demo effects implemented in C often use direct access to the display hardware for performance reasons. Since Flash does not provide direct access to physical devices, we must settle for using the BitmapData class as our drawing buffer and optimize our code within the bounds of its API.</p>
<p>But before we get around to simulating our effect, let us first spend some time understand the principles behind how it is created.</p>
<h3>The Sine Wave</h3>
<p>A sine wave is mathematical function that plots a smooth, repetitive oscillation and is represented in its simplest form as y(t) = A · sin(ωt + Φ) where A is the amplitude or peak deviation of the function from its centre position, ω is the frequency and specifies how many oscillations occur in a unit time interval in radians per second and Φ is the phase, which specifies where the oscillation cycle begins when t = 0.</p>
<p>With this information we can create a simple function to plot a sine wave.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">public function Draw(e:Event):void 
{
    var x1:Number = -1;
    var x2:Number = -1;
    var y1:int = -1;
    var y2:int = -1;
    var amplitude:Number = 120;
    var frequency:Number = 1 * Math.PI / 180; // Convert degree to radians

    for (x1 = 0; x1 &lt; 320; x1++)
    {
        y1 = Math.round(amplitude * Math.sin(frequency * x1)) + 120;
        DrawingUtils.lineBresenham2(this.m_bd, x1, y1, x2, y2, 0xFF000000);
        x2 = x1;
        y2 = y1;
    }
}</pre>
<p><div id="swf39421">This movie requires Flash Player 9</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
	swfobject.embedSWF("http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wave.swf", "swf39421", "320", "240", "9.0.0", "", {}, {wmode: "window", menu: "false", quality: "high", bgcolor: "#FFFFFF", allowScriptAccess: "always"}, {});
</script>
</p>
<p>We use <a title="Breaking Free from Your API" href="http://www.notadesigner.com/breaking-free-from-your-api/">the Bresenham line drawing algorithm</a> instead of setPixel to plot the curve on the bitmap for better fidelity.</p>
<div id="attachment_176" style="width: 352px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wave-effect-a.jpg" alt="" title="wave-effect-a" width="342" height="302" class="size-full wp-image-176" /><p id="caption-attachment-176" class="wp-caption-text">Image A: The image is taller than the red viewport</p></div>
<h3>Creating Waves with Images</h3>
<p>The same principles can be used to create a wave effect on an image. Instead of plotting points on a canvas, columns of an image are scaled up or down depending upon the shape of the wave. The image is scaled down at points where the wave forms a crest and scaled up wherever the wave forms a trough.</p>
<p>Because of the scaling required, the image we use is larger than the viewable area. Image A illustrates this. The red outline is the viewable area of our movie, whereas the image used is taller than that. If the image is not tall enough you will see white patches at the bottom of the movie when the animation begins.</p>
<div id="attachment_182" style="width: 352px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/wave-effect-b.jpg" alt="" title="wave-effect-b" width="342" height="265" class="size-full wp-image-182" /><p id="caption-attachment-182" class="wp-caption-text">Image B: Extract a single vertical slice</p></div>
<div id="attachment_177" style="width: 352px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wave-effect-c.jpg" alt="" title="wave-effect-c" width="342" height="265" class="size-full wp-image-177" /><p id="caption-attachment-177" class="wp-caption-text">Image C: Scale the extracted portion</p></div>
<div id="attachment_178" style="width: 352px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wave-effect-d.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wave-effect-d.jpg" alt="" title="wave-effect-d" width="342" height="262" class="size-full wp-image-178" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-178" class="wp-caption-text">Image D: Paste the slice back into the image</p></div>
<p>Each time the screen is to be refreshed, the function cycles over all the columns in the image. The columns are 1 pixel wide in the movie, but for illustration, image B shows the columns as 40 pixels wide. Image C shows how the extracted image column is then scaled down.</p>
<p>When all images are placed next to each other, they appear to make a wave, as shown in image D. While the effect looks very blocky in this illustration due to the wider column widths used, thinner columns used in the final movie give a smoother output.</p>
<p>Further fine-tuning can be done by changing the wavelength of the sine wave. A large value is used in the example below, causing all the columns in the image to shrink and expand at almost the same rate. A smaller value used in its place would have caused a broad discrepancy in the scaling values for each column. Having columns with both large and small values in the same frame would cause a wider range of distortion in the image, and speed up the motion. Effectively, frequency can be used to increase or decrease the speed of the animation, simulating choppy or calm waters as needed.</p>
<p>The function we use is as shown below.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">public function Draw(e:Event):void
{
    var img:int;
    var wd:int;
    var y:Number;
    var mx:Matrix;

    for (y = 0; y &lt; 240; y++)
    {
        img = 0; 
        wd = Math.round(Math.sin(aa) * 20) + 320;
        mx = new Matrix();
        mx.scale(1, wd / 320);

        this.m_bd.draw(this.m_rg[img], mx, null, null, new Rectangle(0, y, 320, 1), true);
        aa += 0.01;
    }

    aa = ab;
    ab += 1 * Math.PI / 180;

<p>The only difference we need to make in our scaffolding code is to call the Draw effect repeatedly when trying to animate the wave effect, whereas drawing the sine wave can be done by calling the function just once on startup.</p>
<p>The entire codebase with both the effects and scaffolding code is <a href='http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/wave-effects.zip'>available for download here</a>. To change the effect shown, change the value of the m_fxName variable in Main.as to either SineWave or WaveEffect. New effects can be added by extending the BaseEffect class and changing the value of the m_fxName variable to the newly created class name.</p>

		<p>Project Euler is a collection of mathematical problems for the programmer who enjoys taxing his brain cells once in a while. The problems are ordered to be successively difficult to solve, which explains why, as of today, 91,510 people have solved problem one, while problem 283 is solved only by 9 people. Not only are they successively more taxing, but going through so many problems itself is a tedious task that requires mental stamina even when taken in installments over several days.</p>
<div class="side-note">
<h3>Understanding the sum of numbers from 1 to N</h3>
<p>Diagram A shows a square with each side 10 units long. A green diagonal cuts the square into two equal triangles. The number of squares making up the square equals 10 x 10 = 100.</p>
<div id="attachment_163" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-163" title="sum-of-numbers-a" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sum-of-numbers-a.png" alt="" width="150" height="149" /><p id="caption-attachment-163" class="wp-caption-text">Diagram A</p></div>
<p>Diagram B shows one half of the triangle, whose base and height are 10 units for a total of 55 cells. The number of cells can be calculated by adding the number of cells in each column, i.e. 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55.</p>
<p>A similar blue triangle is placed above the red triangle in diagram C, in a way that both triangles are touching but do not overlap. Both triangles encompass 55 units and have sides of 10 units each. They combine to make a rectangle that is 10 units wide and 11 units tall. The total number of cells in the rectangle is 55 + 55 = 10 * 11 = 110.</p>
<div id="attachment_164" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-164" title="sum-of-numbers-b" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sum-of-numbers-b.png" alt="" width="150" height="149" /><p id="caption-attachment-164" class="wp-caption-text">Diagram B</p></div>
<p>Thus it can be seen how the total number of cells in one triangle (i.e. N + (N &#8211; 1) + (N &#8211; 2)&#8230;+ 1) can be computed by calculating the area encompassed by a rectangle that is N * (N + 1) and dividing the result by 2.</p>

<p>The good part is that solving a problem helps an individual build an insight that is useful while solving another one later down the line.</p>
<div id="attachment_165" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-165" title="sum-of-numbers-c" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sum-of-numbers-c.png" alt="" width="150" height="158" /><p id="caption-attachment-165" class="wp-caption-text">Diagram C</p></div>
<p>The first problem in Project Euler asks to add all the natural numbers below 1000 which are multiples of 3 or 5. The straightforward way to resolve this is to use a loop from 1 to 999 that uses a modulus operation to evaluate each integer between 1 and 1000 with 3 and 5, adding the ones that are perfectly divisible and discarding the rest.</p>
<p>Here’s an implementation of this code in ActionScript.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">var sum:uint = 0;
for (var i:uint = 1; i &lt; 1000; i++)
    if ((0 == i % 3) || (0 == x % 5)) sum += i;
trace(sum);</pre>
<p>But the secondary goal of these problems is to have an implementation that can return an answer in less than one minute. Problem one is not all that taxing for a modern computer, making even a naïve implementation run well within the required time frame. But complexity for later problems increases exponentially, making the selection of a fast algorithm very essential.</p>
<p>Hence, it is required that one should understand the mathematical principle behind each problem in order to write an efficient solution.</p>
<p>A step-by-step breakdown of the complex, but more efficient solution goes as follows.</p>
<p>The smallest multiple of 3 greater than 1 is 3 itself.</p>
<p>The largest multiple of 3 less than 1000 can be computed easily.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">multiples = (1000 - 1) / 3
multiples = 333.33
multiples = floor(remainder)
multiples = 333</pre>
<p>The floor() function is used to discard the decimal part of the result by mapping the real number into the previous smallest integer.</p>
<p>The result, 333, is the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 1000. So the sum of these values can be computed by adding the multiples together.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">(1 * 3) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 3)...+ (333 * 3)
= 3 (1 + 2 + 3...333)</pre>
<p>The sum of numbers between 1 and n is n (n + 1) / 2. So the sum of 1 to 333 is 333 (333 + 1) / 2, which is 55,611. Multiplying that by 3 gives you 166,833, which is the sum of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 1000.</p>
<p>The same method can be used to compute the sum of multiples of 5 between 1 and 1,000, to get a result of 99,500.</p>
<p>The problem asks to compute the sum of multiples of 3 or 5. What we have done so far is compute the sum of multiples of 3 and 5. To remove the overlap between the two sets, compute the least common multiple of the two numbers, which is 15, and calculate the sum of multiples of that number between 1 and 1000. Subtracting that set from the first two will result in a set which contains numbers which are either multiples of 3 or 5 but not both.</p>
<p>The same principle also applies when the sum of multiples of 15 is deducted from the sum of multiples of 3 plus the sum of multiples of 5.</p>
<p>So your final solution is sumOfMultiples(3) + sumOfMultiples(5) &#8211; sumOfMultiples(15).</p>
<p>The complete implementation of the program is as follows.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">package 
{
    import flash.display.Sprite;

    /**
     * Project Euler solutions entry point
     */
    public class Main extends Sprite 
    {
        public function Main():void 
        {
            var p:IProblem = new Problem1();
            trace(p.solve());
        }
    }
}

package  
{
    /**
     * If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are
     * multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum
     * of these multiples is 23.
     * 
     * Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
     */
    public class Problem1 implements IProblem
    {
        public function solve():uint
        {
            var limit:uint = 999;
            trace((sumOfMultiples(3, limit) + sumOfMultiples(5, limit)) - sumOfMultiples(15, limit));
        }

        private function sumOfMultiples(factor:uint, limit:uint):uint
        {
            return factor * sum1toN(limit / factor);
        }

        private function sum1toN(n:uint):uint
        {
            return Math.round((n * (n + 1)) / 2);
        }
    }

	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I leapt headfirst into multimedia development a decade ago, there was just one go-to product for all interactive needs – Macromedia Director. With origins in the vastly successful MacroMind VideoWorks application, Director had a strong pedigree in multimedia production. Regular updates of the product over more than a decade had converted the original VideoWorks into a development environment with an object-oriented programming language of its own called Lingo. It also supported external plug-ins for added features, ran on Windows and Macintosh computers and supported all media formats of the day – plain text, images, sound and video. The greatest plus point of Director was its ability to create a projector out of the Director file, which was an executable file that bundled the player and the binary file along with any plugins that were used. The projector was guaranteed to work on any system without requiring any additional libraries (except maybe audio and video codecs).</p>
<h3>A new age, a new champion</h3>
<p>Then the whole web thing happened and Director could not keep pace any more. Macromedia shipped Xtras to support more media formats such as hypertext and Flash, and to make network requests. They also shipped the Shockwave browser plug-in to run a Director file in the browser. But it was no match for the Flash plug-in, which was a fraction of the download. This weighed heavily in the dial-up era back then. Chinks in the development environment began to take their toll. The biggest flaw of Director was that it bundled media and scripts in its working file into a single binary blob and saved it to disk. This meant that version control tools could not diff the scripts against previous revisions. Developers could not collaborate and work upon the same project without leaping through significant loops. The files would sometimes get damaged and become unreadable if there were power failures or other system breakdowns while the file was being saved. There was no easy way to create and reuse libraries. And the eccentric syntax of the Lingo language was a black mark on its developers, who could never gain any repute among people who used ‘real’ programming languages with curly braces.</p>
<p>When Flash began to gain a foothold in the market because of its reach and ease of use, multimedia developers began to move on to the new platform in a steady trickle over the years, until Director became a niche production environment. The situation gave Macromedia a chance to right the problems of Director on a new platform, blank as a clean slate. And they capitalized upon it in a stellar manner. ActionScript quickly morphed from a simple scripting language with a handful of constructs, to a full-blown development environment that supported complex object hierarchies, most OOP principles, a rich API for various tasks ranging from media control to network access, all packaged inside a runtime that was tiny and already available on most of the internet-enabled computers. And it had curly braces.</p>
<h3>A web of entanglement</h3>
<p>Yet, the biggest drawback of Flash was its sandbox that prevented developers from doing anything beyond the boundaries of the browser. Local file system access was out. Native nested windows were out. Drag and drop was not available. Launching native processes was out. Projector files were slightly more forgiving and allowed read-only local file access and limited spawning of new processes. But this was nowhere close to the unrestricted freedom offered by Director projectors. This in itself was not bad most of the time. But when more serious functionality was needed, ActionScript developers had to depend upon another programming language to get the job done. To be fair, Macromedia, and now Adobe have always done their best to make cross-language interop as easy as possible. We have come a long way from the getURL() calls required in ActionScript 1 to today’s ExternalInterface API. But a dependency meant having to support yet another codebase.</p>
<h3>Breaking free</h3>
<p>It was heartening then to hear of the Adobe AIR announcement some years ago. Finally, Flash applications could be written to take advantage of local facilities of the system along with the existing media and internet API’s. It was now possible to read and write local files in a meaningful manner. Network utilities could be a lot more proactive and efficient. Applications could update themselves transparently and could support richer desktop paradigms such as taskbar icons and drag-and-drop interactions.</p>
<p>There still isn’t complete unfettered access to the system, the way Director projectors could. But this limitation will remain due to the different security scenario today. Being able to sell AIR as a secure replacement for web applications is highly desirable for Adobe in the face of HTML 5 and the advancing capabilities of browsers. But combined with all the other benefits that Flash offers, along with the reduced development time over other desktop development environments, and instant cross-platform compatibility, this is an insignificant bump.</p>
<p>The only drawback that AIR has over Director is that it requires a separate download of the AIR runtime. At 11 MB, it does not add a significant cost in today’s age. But it is a deal breaker for users without administrative rights. There really should be a way to package the runtime and the application package into a single executable.</p>
<h3>HTML is not the only future</h3>
<p>There still are naysayers who predict that the Flash platform is dead. All that is needed is wider acceptance and support for HTML 5. But with support for HTML and JavaScript built into AIR (with WebKit, no less), Adobe already has that base covered. And the web is not the do-all and end-all of computing. While having a social networking application online makes sense, personal accounting or mail applications are better kept locally for security and accessibility reasons. And desktop applications have the unique ability to morph into hybrids that work locally as well as with remote services, which is better in some cases than having a web-only application. Most people already use a hybrid application – their mail client. New mails can be downloaded and read when connected online, while still being able to access downloaded emails when working offline.</p>
<p>Sure the W3C is working on writing specifications for similar functionality with HTML 5. But who said choice is bad? Given the sorry state of browser standardization even today, it is more likely that each browser publisher will implement the spec in some half-assed manner that causes subtle differences between them and require someone to invent a shim to fix those incompatibilities. And HTML 5 does not address all the features that AIR supports, including hardware accelerated 3D and filter effects, native menus, file extension registration, drag and drop, advanced sound and video API’s and windowing support beyond the most rudimentary.</p>
<p>In spite of all the advantages that it has, AIR has failed to make major inroads into desktop development. Blame lies squarely on Adobe for failing to promote it well enough. Other than ActionScript developer circles, there rarely is any mention or knowledge of the platform. They really ought to pick up some steam on that front and corner the market the way Director and Flash have done in their time.</p>
