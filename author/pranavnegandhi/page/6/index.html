<p>Having spent the first day getting familiar with the site, I was a lot more confident now of being able to do some justice to the royal enclosure without the aid of a guide. We had to spend time waiting for Mango Tree, the restaurant from the evening before, to open up for breakfast before we could go ahead. The food there was so nice that we were now unwilling to take risks elsewhere. After pancakes and grilled sandwiches, all washed down with hot chocolate, we were ready for the day&#8217;s adventures.</p>
<div id="attachment_342" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/krishna-temple/" rel="attachment wp-att-342"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-342" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/krishna-temple-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="At the Krishna Temple" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-342" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-342" class="wp-caption-text">At the Krishna Temple</p></div>
<p>Unlike at the religious centre, vehicles can be driven into the royal enclosure. In fact, this is the recommended way of exploring here, simply because of the distances between different sites. They usually lie at least 2-3 kilometres away from each other. Add up the walking required within their premises and possibly going back and forth for meals, and you&#8217;re looking at an ungodly figure which causes a lot of wasted time by the end of the day. Even a bicycle is better than walking.</p>
<div id="attachment_350" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/krishna-temple-gate/" rel="attachment wp-att-350"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-350" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/krishna-temple-gate-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="Stucco sculptures on the Krishna Temple gate" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-350" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-350" class="wp-caption-text">Stucco sculptures on the temple gate depict the victory of Krishnadevaraya in his campaign against the kingdom of Utkala.</p></div>
<p>This circuit covers the Krishna Temple, Ugra Narsimha idol, underground Shiva Temple, Hazara Rama Temple, the zenana complex, elephant stables and several other sites. The ASI museum also falls on this same route, although we did not have time to visit.</p>
<h3>The Morning Session</h3>
<p>We started off with the <a href="http://hampi.in/krishna-temple">Krishna Temple</a>, which takes at least an hour for a casual look around. While the complex is not all that large as such, it has several structures and some well-preserved relief sculptures which immediately catch the eye. For those with an eye for detail and the time to spare, this site itself can consume several hours.</p>
<div id="attachment_343" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/krishna-temple-dasha-avatar/" rel="attachment wp-att-343"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/krishna-temple-dasha-avatar-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="Dasha Avatar reliefs at the temple gates" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-343" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-343" class="wp-caption-text">Dasha Avatar reliefs at the temple gates</p></div>
<p>Krishnadevaraya commissioned construction in the 16th century to celebrate his victory over the kingdom of Utkala in present-day Orissa. The original idol of Balakrishna has been relocated to the state museum in Chennai. The main structure as well as accompanying shrines and pillared halls are all beautifully carved, partly due to the temples relatively recent vintage. Some things to note are the figures of Yalis on the pillars of the main structure, and the reliefs of the 10 avatars of Vishnu at the main gate.</p>
<p>The underground Shiva Temple, up next in the route map, was a bit of a downer due to lack of maintenance and the resultant flooding of the interiors. Architecturally too, this place is nothing particularly substantial to speak of. It is a convenient location to waste away hot afternoons due to its cooler temperatures and surrounding gardens. Bring a food basket and a mat to make a picnic out of it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_345" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/pillar-of-exquisite-beauty/" rel="attachment wp-att-345"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-345" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/pillar-of-exquisite-beauty-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="Tourists strike a pose inside the mukhmantapa at the Hazara Rama Temple" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-345" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-345" class="wp-caption-text">Tourists strike a pose inside the mukhmantapa at the Hazara Rama Temple</p></div><br />
Another location great for hiding out from the sun and heat is the mosque, just a short distance away from the underground Shiva Temple. This is actually a large complex with several structures including a watch tower, a band tower and a mosque. We sat under the shade in the mosque for a while to catch some relief from the heat before moving on to the <a href="http://hampi.in/hazara-rama-temple">Hazara Rama Temple</a>.</p>
<p>This is easily one of the nicest and best-preserved sites here, on par with the Krishna Temple. This temple is popular for the carved reliefs of the Ramayana on its walls. While this site is not as large as any of the other temple complexes in Hampi, its importance is greatly elevated due to its central location in the royal enclosure. Historians believe that this temple was used as a private shrine for the king and the royal family.</p>
<div id="attachment_339" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/hazara-rama-temple/" rel="attachment wp-att-339"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-339" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/hazara-rama-temple-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="At the Hazara Rama Temple" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-339" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-339" class="wp-caption-text">At the Hazara Rama Temple<br /></p></div>
<p>A small open-air museum and merchandise store lies at the ASI office nearby. The artifacts and idols here are worth looking at, in spite of the apparent lack of visitors. Also of note is the photo museum where you can see prints of original works by Alexandar Greenlaw and John Gollings. Greenlaw was a member of the British army with an interest in surveying and documenting the regions of the empire. He was part of the earliest efforts of the British to establish an archeological survey department in India. His photographs, lost for many years, were discovered in 1980 in a private collection. His waxed paper negatives provide an insight into the earliest records of discovery and excavation at Hampi. Replicating his photographs with modern technology is a popular activity for many visitors today.</p>
<div id="attachment_344" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/maha-mantapa/" rel="attachment wp-att-344"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/maha-mantapa-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="Musical pillars at the Vittala Temple" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-344" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-344" class="wp-caption-text">The main hall of the Vittala Temple, reknowned for its musical pillars</p></div>
<p>We covered them up to the elephant stables before returning back to Mango Tree for lunch (yes, it was <em>that</em> good). After whiling away the worst of the afternoon under its shady interiors, we rode back to the Vittala Temple to do better justice to it in the soft evening light.</p>
<p>Vittala Temple is a lot more easily accessible from the royal enclosure side. You can park your vehicle at the parking lot and either walk the 2 kilometres to the temple, or take an electric car which charges Rs. 20 for a to-and-fro ticket. Walking gives you the option of stopping at Pushkarni, a stepped tank which lies close to the Vittala Temple. We chose to take the car because of the crazy heat. The weather only began to get more tolerable after 5:30 pm while we were in the temple premises.</p>
<p>The day ended with an early ride back to the hotel, mediocre but convenient hotel room service dinner and an early lights-out in preparation for the ride to Badami the next day.</p>
<div id="attachment_346" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/riding-through-hampi/" rel="attachment wp-att-346"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-346" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/riding-through-hampi-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="In between sites" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-346" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-346" class="wp-caption-text">Riding through the dusty roads between sites<br /></p></div>
<h4>Final Impressions</h4>
<p>While we did visit Hampi in this trip, I cannot rightly say that we have done it justice. Two days is barely enough to get familiar with the layout. I could spend a week here before beginning to get bored. If you are a history buff, you could probably spend even more time. Adventure seekers too come here frequently to climb the unending expanses of rocky boulders and hills. And there&#8217;s something for all levels of difficulty – from straight out steps cut into the rock, to flat-faced ledges that require strength and skill to scale. The third interesting activity is to ride out into the countryside and just soak in the sights. Natural surroundings and a variety of avian population can guarantee a fun ride. The nearby bear sanctuary also sounds promising, although we didn&#8217;t have the time to visit.</p>
<div id="attachment_348" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-second-day-at-hampi/sun-temple/" rel="attachment wp-att-348"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-348" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sun-temple.jpg" alt="" title="The stone chariot, a shrine to Garuda, at the Vittala Temple" width="800" height="600" class="size-full wp-image-348" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-348" class="wp-caption-text">The stone chariot, a shrine to Garuda, at the Vittala Temple</p></div>
<p>Either my expectations were set to high for the food and accommodation arrangements, or the place really does suck. While Hotel Karthik, where we were put up, had decent reviews online, the actual experience was not quite up to the mark. Especially on the food front, I found the hotel restaurant, Nalpak (promptly rechristened Nalayak by me), to be lacking in quality and variety. Their North Indian fare was boring. And who the hell wants to eat North Indian food while in Southern India? Mango Tree and its cuisine of rich, spicy and aromatic curries and South Indian thalis was evidence that there is more to this cuisine than just idlis and dosas. But most service outlets are unwilling to experiment. There&#8217;s a reason that Mango Tree gets great reviews and frequently returning visitors.</p>

<p>At Belgaum, Anvith had mentioned of people having made several visits to Hampi and still discovering something new and interesting to see. The ruins of the old Vijayanagara capital are spread over such a large expanse, that it is impossible to see everything and do it justice in a two-day trip. With settlements dating back to 2000 years ago being found here, this is not surprising at all. The Ramayana too has mentions of Kishkindha, the mythological capital of the monkey kings Vali and Sugriva, and Matanga Hill, both of which are located here. Anjanagiri Hill nearby is supposed to have been the birthplace of Hanuman.</p>
<div id="attachment_332" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-first-day-at-hampi/hemakuta-hill/" rel="attachment wp-att-332"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-332" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-332" title="From the top of Hemakuta Hill" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/hemakuta-hill-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-332" class="wp-caption-text">View of the Krishna Temple and Ganesh Temple from the top of Hemakuta Hill</p></div>
<p>Being on our first trip here, we decided to not expect much by way of sense or structure, and just take things as they come. We hired a guide near the Sasivekalu Ganesh Temple for Rs. 600 for half a day. In hindsight, this was very, very steep, especially considering that April to September is the off season. You&#8217;re better off going all the way up to the tourist information office near the Virupaksha Temple ahead and hiring a guide from there. Do carry a map with you, else buy a cheap guide book (Rs. 20) from the local vendors. They also sell a more expensive (Rs. 100) guide book, purportedly published by the ASI, with much better print quality and colour photographs. But this book has no local map of the ruins themselves. I found this rather pointless since all monuments already have detailed write-ups put up on the sign boards outside. It is recommended to either carry your own map with the points of interest marked, or to buy the cheaper book with the map.</p>

<p>The guides break up the place into two major sections – the religious sites and the royal monuments. Religious sites consist of the Hemakuta Hill, Virupaksha Temple, Hampi Bazar, Matanga Hill, Kodanda Rama Temple, Achyutraya Temple and several other smaller sites, culminating at the <a href="http://hampi.in/vittala-temple">Vittala Temple</a>. If you&#8217;re up for a boat ride, a coracle can take you across the Tungabhadra River to see the Hanuman Temple on Anjanagiri Hill. I declined because of my general dislike for travelling on any surface other than solid ground. Quotes began at Rs. 150 per person, and can go substantially lower depending on your bargaining skills. Make brazen and shameless counter offers.</p>
<div id="attachment_326" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-first-day-at-hampi/anjanagiri-hill/" rel="attachment wp-att-326"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-326" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-326" title="On the banks of the Tungabhadra" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/anjanagiri-hill-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-326" class="wp-caption-text">Living it off on the banks of the Tungabhadra. The Anjanagiri Mountain can be seen in the distance.</p></div>
<p>The royal enclosure falls on the other side of the main approach road to Hampi. This consists of the Krishna Temple, the underground Shiva Temple, Hazara Rama Temple, the Zenana, elephant stables and several other smaller sites. This route also ends at the Vittala Temple, which is pretty much the best preserved of the entire lot of monuments in Hampi. We visited the religious centre on our first day here, covering the entire portion up to the Vittala Temple by foot with the guide.</p>
<p>The convenience of having your own vehicle, especially a small fuel-powered moped or motorcycle, is unmatched. We saw seweral foreign tourists on rental mopeds. Indian visitors generally have their own vehicles or rent autorickshaws. Some walk. I did not see any obviously touristy-looking Indians on rental mopeds, although they are very common with the locals. Cars are fine, but they cannot go into narrow tracks which are common in the religious centre. If you don&#8217;t mind riding in the heat, you can rent a bicycle. We only saw one tourist on a rental bicycle in Hampi for this reason. Autorickshaws are also available if you prefer, but they are expensive. In any case, expect to do a lot of walking. Even with a motor vehicle to travel between different sites, most of the palaces and temple complexes are very large from within. On our first day, we walked from Hemakuta Hill all the way up to the Vittala Temple, back to Hampi Bazar for lunch in the afternoon, and then back again to Vittala Temple to take photographs in the mellow evening light. Then we walked back to the parking lot near Sasivekalu Ganesh Temple, which added up to at least 8-10 kilometres in all.</p>

<h4>Under the Mango Tree</h4>
<p>Food was a big problem the evening before at Hospet. Even at Hampi, lunch was average at best. The evening meal suddenly became much better, due to the chance mention of our guide of a restaurant called Mango Tree. Situated off the main access road, you can see a sign board to the restaurant at a junction half a kilometre from the Sasivekalu Ganesh Temple parking lot. Watch out for a large arch on the right hand side as you ride on your way back. Turn right here and pass through a small village until you reach the end of the road. A downhill slope on the right over paved stones takes you to what seemed like a gated private estate or farm. Cars must be parked outside the gate, but a smaller gate at the side lets bikes inside. Park near the gate and walk a short distance through banana plantations to the restaurant. Built on the banks of the river, the stepped terraces make for a very pleasant and private seating area. While they do serve continental food, their spicy local delicacies are to die for. Especially high on the list are the coconut curry and a variety of ‘parotas’ – a house speciality pie with different types of stuffing such as potatoes, cheese or fruit.</p>
<div id="attachment_327" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-first-day-at-hampi/diet-coke/" rel="attachment wp-att-327"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-327" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-327" title="The Mango Tree Restaurant at Hampi" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/diet-coke.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-327" class="wp-caption-text">Everything tastes better with a Diet Coke</p></div>
<p>The ride back to Hospet was uneventful. The convenience of having a motorcycle was especially evident again, as we rode through the dark night. Had we been in an autorickshaw or hampered by bus schedules, the evening would have been on a much tighter leash.</p>

<p>Hampi itself is a small village without significant facilities. Most tourist guides recommend staying at Hospet instead, which is about 13 kilometres away, and as an industrial city, offers a significantly improved urban infrastructure than Hampi. Both places fall in the Bellary district of Karnataka state. It lies about 250 kilometres from Belgaum.</p>
<div id="attachment_280" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/belgaum-vidhan-soudha-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-280"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-280" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-280" title="Belgaum Vidhan Soudha" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/belgaum-vidhan-soudha1-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-280" class="wp-caption-text">A closer look at the Belgaum Vidhan Soudha building under construction</p></div>
<p>We left at around 7 am from Belgaum, later by an hour than planned. We were still quite tired and had to yet catch up with sleep. Good roads with little traffic and wind, meant we were able to reach Hubli (100 kilometres) by 9 am. Our original plan consisted of stopping at Kittur to see the fort there. But we had poor reviews from Anvith about the condition of the fort, because of which we preferred to take our chances with the temples at Lakkundi instead. This was a choice we wouldn&#8217;t regret.</p>
<div id="attachment_281" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/brahma-jinalaya/" rel="attachment wp-att-281"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-281" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-281" title="Exteriors of the Brahma Jinalaya Temple" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/brahma-jinalaya-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-281" class="wp-caption-text">Exteriors of the Brahma Jinalaya Temple</p></div>
<p>The road to Hospet diverges from the Bangalore highway after Hubli. Surface conditions are significantly worse on SH 67 than the national highway, along with narrower roads. But sparse traffic and plenty of tree cover to break the wind allowed for good speeds. The only drawback was the complete absence of traveller facilities – food and toilets were both conspicuously absent. By the time we reached Gadag, we were starving and completely drained. I was hoping to find at least a decent restaurant in Gadag, the last major town till Hospet. But nothing worthwhile turned up there either. A lonely dhaba a few kilometres after Gadag turned out to be our last option. The kitchen did not offer anything substantial other than rice, which was palatable, but only barely. It did provide enough sustenance to last until Hospet, at least, which was much more than one could ask out there.</p>
<div id="attachment_282" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/brahma-jinalaya-shikhara-details/" rel="attachment wp-att-282"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-282" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-282" title="Shikhara details at the Brahma Jinalaya" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/brahma-jinalaya-shikhara-details-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-282" class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the shikhara details at the Brahma Jinalaya</p></div>
<p>The kilometres began to melt again until Lakkundi.</p>
<h4>Lakkundi – Big Things in a Small Package</h4>
<p>Most people we spoke to had never heard of Lakkundi, a tiny village between Gadag and Hospet. Archeological resources point out as many as 50 temples, 100 stepped wells and several inscriptions of various vintages within its vicinity. Its insignificant size belies the archeological and cultural significance it holds. Chalukyas and Hoysalas once held this village as part of their empire.</p>
<div id="attachment_283" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/brahma-jinalaya-shikhara-details-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-283"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-283" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-283" title="Close-up of the shikhara details at the Brahma Jinalaya" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/brahma-jinalaya-shikhara-details-2-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-283" class="wp-caption-text">The quality of detail and finish in the Lakkundi temples is significantly greater than the ones at Badami. Due credit should go to the improved skill of the artisans and the better material to work with.</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasivisvesvara_temple,_Lakkundi">Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi</a> is considered a pinnacle of the Kalyani Chalukya architectural style. It is an important link between the early Chalukya style, seen at Badami, and Hoysala architecture who immediately followed the Chalukya empire. One is easily captured right at the doorway itself, by the elaborate nine-layered mouldings of the doorway frame and an intricate carving in relief of Gajalakshmi. Opposite to the main entrace lies a shrine to Surya, the Sun god.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.karnataka.com/gadag/lakkundi-brahma-jinalaya/">Brahma Jinalaya</a> is an interesting temple which was originally consecerated as a <a href="http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/08-09/features1472.htm">Jain basadi</a> by queen Attimabe, wife of a local chieftain called Nagadeva. It is built out of chloric schist, which is more workable for detailed carvings compared to sandstone which was otherwise popular in this region. The difference in intricacy and finishing is noticeable.</p>
<div id="attachment_293" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/brahma-jinalaya-shikhara/" rel="attachment wp-att-293"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-293" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-293" title="Shikhara at the Brahma Jinalaya" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/brahma-jinalaya-shikhara-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-293" class="wp-caption-text">Shikhara at the Brahma Jinalaya</p></div>
<p>According to the description board put up by the ASI outside, the temple was once used to worship a larger idol of an unknown tirthankara. Its name probably originates from either the Brahma idol inside the sanctum, or from the approval the temple received from the Brahmanas of Lokkigundi.</p>
<p>The last site that we had time to visit at Lakkundi was the Nanneswara Temple, just opposite the Kasivisvesvara Temple. It is believed to have been built as a prototype to the much more elaborately detailed Kasivisvesvara Temple.</p>
<div id="attachment_287" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/kasivisvanath-temple/" rel="attachment wp-att-287"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-287" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-287" title="Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/kasivisvanath-temple-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-287" class="wp-caption-text">Kasivisvesvara Temple – what a tongue twister&#8230;</p></div>
<h4>To Hospet!</h4>
<p>We spent a good two hours in just these three sites at Lakkundi. If you have time, guide books recommend visiting the Manikeshwara Temple and stepped tank here. Since it was past 3 pm, we preferred to give these two a pass and move onwards. The road continued to remain mostly featureless other than vast open plains and fields until we reached Koppal and Ginigera. The landscape suddenly was strewn with large boulders, a sign that we were nearing Hospet and Hampi.</p>
<div id="attachment_292" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/kasivisvanath-temple-doorway/" rel="attachment wp-att-292"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-292" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-292" title="Doorway at the Kasivisvesvaraya Temple" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/kasivisvanath-temple-doorway-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-292" class="wp-caption-text">Decorative door panels, assembled from nine layers of intricate carvings</p></div>
<p>The road is currently being rebuilt from the junction of SH 67 and NH 13 all the way up to Hospet, which caused a lot of trouble. The dust and uneven surface are the least of worries. One also has to deal with rash driving between laden construction vehicles and frequent detours. To make matters worse, repairs were also ongoing at College Road, a major thoroughfare in the city of Hospet. In all, the last 20 kilometres took us close to an hour to cover. After a week of honing my handling skills on bad roads, I think I might be able to do it much faster.</p>
<div id="attachment_288" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/kasivisvanath-temple-exteriors/" rel="attachment wp-att-288"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-288" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-288" title="Plinth around the Kasivisvesvaraya Temple" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/kasivisvanath-temple-exteriors-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-288" class="wp-caption-text">Rows of elephants, horses and mythical creatures surround the plinth of the temple</p></div>
<p>At Hospet, we were stopped by local traffic police. The officer demanded my license, which was in postal transit from the Maharashtra RTO office at the time of leaving from Pune. I had a reciept in lieu of the licence, which pissed off the officer. He demanded to see the rest of the vehicle documentation, which I promptly presented for inspection. He still seemed to have a grudge about the missing license, but quickly backed out when I offered to call the Maharashtra RTO office to clarify the matter. As suggested by forum members from Bike Nomads, the key is confidence. Having everything else in order also helps. The fear of having to deal with inter-state bureaucracy also probably a big deterrent.</p>
<div id="attachment_289" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-belgaum-to-hospet/ravana-lifting-kailash/" rel="attachment wp-att-289"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-289" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-289" title="Ravana lifting Mount Kailash" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ravana-lifting-kailash-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-289" class="wp-caption-text">Ravana lifting Mount Kailash, the adobe of Shiva</p></div>
<p>Finding Hotel Karthik was a bit of a problem due to the construction activity on College Road and late hour. And the rooms and food were a bit of a disappointment. Having nothing better to do, we turned in early.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We woke up on time for a change, although we were still quite fatigued by yesterday&#8217;s long ride. Anvith called at 5:15 sharp. He was at the hotel gates. We loaded up some essentials and leftover snacks from the day before, and piled up outside the gates.</p>
<div id="attachment_272" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-riding-around-belgaum/morning-glory/" rel="attachment wp-att-272"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-272" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-272" title="Morning glory" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/morning-glory-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-272" class="wp-caption-text">Morning glory</p></div>
<h4>Part I – Yellurgarh and Nandgad</h4>
<p>We followed him through empty streets of Belgaum until we were out of the city and in the countryside. It didn&#8217;t take long either. While the city roads were quite manageable, the surface turned to hell in the countryside. The Impulse handled it all very well, while the Thunderbird, with its lazy geometry and loaded with the pillion, felt like an ox. We reached Yellurgarh an hour since leaving the hotel room. Thankfully, the last climb up to the fort gates was made up of excellent tarmac. Bad roads were forgiven for the experience of leaning Anna through those curves.</p>
<div id="attachment_270" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-riding-around-belgaum/its-showtime/" rel="attachment wp-att-270"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-270" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-270" title="It's showtime!" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/its-showtime-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-270" class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s showtime!</p></div>
<p>We parked outside the fort gates and hiked the short distance up. The light was good and there was a slight nip in the air. After walking around the rather small premises, we sat down for breakfast in the morning light. Anvith played the perfect host, fishing out coffee, bread, jam and peanut chutney from his bag. Our contribution of a solitary pack of biscuits looked insignificant in comparison.</p>
<div id="attachment_269" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-riding-around-belgaum/climb-uphill/" rel="attachment wp-att-269"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-269" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-269" title="The road up to Yellurgarh" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/climb-uphill-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-269" class="wp-caption-text">The road up to Yellurgarh</p></div>
<p>After breakfast we headed towards Nandgad, to see the church there. Twelve kilometres of beautifully shaded and well made road melted away in no time. Being early, traffic was sparse and we could even stop for a few photographs along the way. After crossing Nandgad village, the road turned bad again, much worse than what I had to suffer in the morning. The Thunderbird kept slipping in the loose gravel and stones. Target fixation is a bitch. My brain frequently interpreted “<em>Don’t</em> look at that rock!” as “Don’t look at <em>that</em> rock!”. And any rider can guess about what my eyes would be fixed upon. I finally gave up about two hundred metres before the bottom of the climb and parked. Anvith, eager to test out his new off-roader, took it higher up, while we followed on foot.</p>
<div id="attachment_268" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-riding-around-belgaum/belgaum-vidhan-soudha/" rel="attachment wp-att-268"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-268" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-268" title="The new Vidhan Soudha building" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/belgaum-vidhan-soudha-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-268" class="wp-caption-text">The new Vidhan Soudha building under construction in the distance</p></div>
<p>The short climb to the top was only a bit difficult because we were loaded down in the heat by my heavy riding jacket and two helmets. The church itself was pretty unique, dedicated as it was to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stations_of_the_Cross">Way of the Cross</a>. Interestingly, the church also maintains <a href="http://nandgadcross.com">their own website</a>. Climbing down was easier, though the sun still beat down mercilessly. After some dithering for photos and refreshments, we split up back again at Belgaum. We were to meet again at 4 for a ride to Belgaum Fort and lake.</p>
<h4>Part II – Belgaum Fort and Lake</h4>
<p>The rains played spoilsport again by pouring down for exactly an hour at 4. Anvith left from his place when it finally stopped and showed up 10 minutes later and we rode off through the cool evening air to Belgaum Fort.</p>

<p>The fort has a history stretching back to the 13th century. It&#8217;s earliest construction was undertaken by a king called Jaya Raya. Over the years, it has gone through several extensions and additions under the Rashtrakutas, kings of Vijayanagar (or Hampi), Sultans of Bijapur, Marathas and finally, the British. It is currently controlled by the Belgaum Cantonment Board and houses some wings of the defence forces. It is open to the public, however, due in no small part to the presence of several temples and mosques inside the fort. Being short on time, we only managed to check out the Kamal Basadi Jain temple, dedicated to the twenty second Tirthankara, Neminath. Photography is prohibited inside the fort premises, which is a pity because this temple has some really beautiful architecture.</p>
<p>This was followed by a short walk around the Belgaum Lake nearby. Being late in the evening, we were not able to walk around the entire circumference, which goes as much as 2-3 kilometres. The evening ended with dinner at the restaurant at our hotel, followed by some more ice cream from Aditya&#8217;s. Thanks to Anvith, this leg of the trip went very, very well. While we are culture buffs, it was his incessant chatter and interesting quips that made the trip real fun. We took with us fond memories.</p>

		<p>The night before we were to leave turned out to last longer than I had anticipated, in spite of my best efforts to get things done on time. Work and packing were taking a toll on my already stretched nerves. Which is why when I finally hit the sack at 1 am, I knew there was no way I&#8217;d be getting up on time again to ride out at 6. Being delayed turned out to be a trend through the rest of the journey, one which I would like to avoid in future trips. Morning hours are the best to ride in. Once past 11 am in peak summer, the heat takes a significant toll on strength and sanity.</p>
<div id="attachment_258" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-pune-to-belgaum/smiles-afire/" rel="attachment wp-att-258"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-258" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-258" title="Bright smiles along the way" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/smiles-afire-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-258" class="wp-caption-text">Bright smiles along the way</p></div>
<p>We both staggered out of bed at 7 and stepped out of the house close to two hours later. Strapping down the luggage took a few more minutes before we were out on our greatest adventure yet. It was 8:45 am. We had missed the best time to travel during the day. At this point, I was only interested in reaching Belgaum safe before nightfall.</p>
<p>Being close to peak hours, the traffic had already become thick throughout Pune city limits, in spite of us being on the highway. It thinned out a bit around Katraj flyover and Jhambulwadi lake, before returning with a vengeance after Nasrapur. An accident between a car and a truck around Kapurhol made things worse. The heat was getting to me and I had given up all hope of ever shifting out of the Thunderbird&#8217;s ever versatile gear 3. We too became unwilling participants in a minor bump and graze when some nut on a bike hit us from behind at a toll booth.</p>
<p>After Shirwal, traffic began to thin out again up to the Khambatki ghat climb. There too, most of the traffic was caused by a single multi-axle truck climbing up hill on the narrow incline. Typical of this hour, many cagers were eager to get past the big vehicle and took a lot of needless risks in the process like driving into the rough and boulder-strewn shoulder. Being hesitant to take risks that could result in us turning into road pizza so early in the journey, I took the safer option to trail at a safe distance until cleared to pass by the driver. Roads became empty again until the end of the ghat at the other side. Thankfully most of the cagers turned off at the Surur junction towards Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar.</p>
<div id="attachment_259" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-pune-to-belgaum/contemplative/" rel="attachment wp-att-259"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-259" title="Contemplative" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/contemplative-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-259" class="wp-caption-text">Weighing the risks of getting killed while riding through district Kolhapur</p></div>
<p>We would soon be entering Kolhapur district, which possibly has the worst ratio of dickbag drivers to rational ones in all the destinations we covered through this trip. Even the famed maniac bus drivers from Karnataka would turn white in the face of a white SUV bearing a registration plate with numbers MH-09 searing down towards them. The only physics applicable in district Kolhapur is horse-power. Friction, trajectories and solid body collisions needn&#8217;t be taught in schools, because they don&#8217;t work here any more (until a collision actually occurs, that is). And what&#8217;s with the obsession with white cars?</p>
<p>The road was mostly clear through the next few towns all the way till a petrol pump 30 kms out of Kolhapur. Roads were good enough to let Anna effortlessly pull along at 80. We stopped for lunch and cool off from the heat for a bit here. The worst of the heat was on the wane at around 2:00 pm. But the relief of food and jugs of water was very welcome. We hit the road an hour later, hoping to wing it to Belgaum by 5 pm.</p>
<p>Past Kolhapur, the landscape gave way to much more open spaces and fewer trees and structures to break the wind. Very strong crosswinds slowed us down to speeds of 50 kilometres an hour. The going was tough, but I persisted. This trip was a very important lesson for me in bike handling skills in varied conditions. And my education had begun with a really difficult course. It took an hour to get past the border of Maharashtra and Karnataka into Nipani. The landscape was still open, but the quality of the roads changed dramatically. Whatever problems Karnataka might have, they sure know how to build good surfaces for their major highways.</p>
<div id="attachment_260" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-pune-to-belgaum/nipani-shrine/" rel="attachment wp-att-260"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-260" title="At Nipani" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/nipani-shrine-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-260" class="wp-caption-text">At Nipani</p></div>
<p>Just outside of Nipani, we stopped at a Jain shrine where Ami wanted to visit. While we were there, the clouds burst in a shower of spontanteity. At first I thought it was a light drizzle, but it quickly escalated into a full-blown downpour. We took shelter inside a school building nearby, closed for summer. It rained for more than an hour with visibility dropping down to as little as 200 metres. I wasn&#8217;t keen on riding out in such weather, so we stayed put and idled away the time in banter. While the weather was a downer, time flew in good conversation and jokes.</p>
<p>We mounted up again after the rain slowed down and rode on gingerly through the drizzle and wet roads. The rain had ceased completely a little distance away, although we could see plenty of storm activity in the distance. I rushed through all my mental notes about riding in the rain, especially during electric storms. I was not sure about the risks of sitting on a large metallic object on broad, open roads with the absence of tree cover. It started raining again not long after but we soldiered on this time at slower pace. We were out of the rain again in a few minutes. It continued to pour down intermittently throughout the rest of the ride as we passed in and out of cloud patches. The ride was uneventful after this, with the sole aim now being getting off the highway before darkness set in.</p>
<div id="attachment_261" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-pune-to-belgaum/outside-belgaum/" rel="attachment wp-att-261"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-261" title="Outside Belgaum" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/outside-belgaum-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-261" class="wp-caption-text">A few kilometres outside Belgaum</p></div>
<p>After an hour or so, we finally crossed the Hindalco Club outside Belgaum city. Finding the hotel and checking in was a breeze. Anvith arrived in the evening with his new Impulse. The evening was topped off with plenty of talk with him over delicious ice cream from Aditya&#8217;s, a local dairy brand. Hot topics of discussion were the day&#8217;s ride, his new bike, nearby places of interest, and life in Belgaum in general. Plans were made to meet at 5:30 am the next day for a ride to Yellurgarh fort.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Every trip I&#8217;ve ever undertaken has been formulated around the idea of making the journey the destination. It is the most natural way to travel. Why anybody would want to miss out on the sights between the origin and destination of a journey is beyond me, especially when you consider that a typical vacation requires a significant amount of time to be spent in travelling. But this adage has never rung truer for me than on this tour, where I would be spending many hours of the day at the helm, directing the entire journey.</p>
<div id="attachment_254" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/tour-of-hampi-prologue/you-me-anna/" rel="attachment wp-att-254"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-254" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-254" title="You, me and Anna" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/you-me-anna-800x532.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="532" srcset="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/you-me-anna-800x532.jpg 800w, https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/you-me-anna.jpg 902w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-254" class="wp-caption-text">You, me and Anna, en route to Nandgad – photo credits Anvith K. S.</p></div>
<p>This was a significant milestone for me in many ways. It was my first time travelling long distances in a vehicle of my own over many days. I have done a few trips to nearby destinations, spanning at most a day or so on my bikes before. But nothing ever came close to this one. Being the first person in the family with a personal vehicle in three generations meant there was no resource of childhood road trip experiences to draw from. It was just me planning my own trip, finding my own way and correcting mistakes as they were made.</p>
<p>Finally, motorcycle touring has been on my radar for the longest amount of time. For those who already ride bikes, this needs no explanation. For those who don&#8217;t or are afraid of bikes, the best way to understand the feeling is to mount saddle and hit the road. This is a pure form of travel which really makes the journey come alive. The destination ceases to be a goal as you soak in the experiences along the way. While I have never driven a car, my negligible experience of travelling as a passenger in one was, to put it mildly, meh. I would much rather brave the elements and the dust than travel in antiseptic insulation from the worst that nature can unleash. In my opinion, if you do not reach your destination dusty and soaked in sweat, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.</p>

	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the better side-effects of working in memory-managed languages is that you don’t have to bother with manually cleaning up references. This removes a huge chunk of busywork for developers who have one less thing to get their heads around. Allocate an object, use it, and forget about it. The garbage collector will get around to it eventually and clean it out.</p>
<p>What could be simpler?</p>
<h3>Great Power, Great Responsibility</h3>
<p>However, with ActionScript 3, the bar has been raised substantially. This new incarnation adds a slew of APIs that increase its expressiveness and capabilities. Yes siree! ActionScript is no longer a toy language whose primary arsenal is gotoAndPlay(). There’s an extensive library of native classes that can do stuff like drawing on screen, playing audio, fetching text and binary data from all sorts of data sources, or even launching and communicating with other applications.</p>
<p>Take that, Java!</p>
<p>Several of these features mean that its legacy garbage collection techniques have to be replaced with less aggressive methods to identify unused memory. This in turn requires more developer intervention than before to identify which references are no longer required and which ones must be left untouched. The new AS3 garbage collector uses reference counting and mark sweeping (both techniques are covered by Grant Skinner here). And while things are still better than completely manual memory management, building complex or long-running applications requires that the developer have at least a passing understanding of how memory is allocated, references stored, passed around and cleared, and the potential for memory leaks in the midst of all this.</p>
<p>This is where the typical ActionScript programmer stumbles, mainly because people programming in AS3 often do not have a formal background in computer science or programming and have usually learned the language on their own through books or online tutorials. It is not uncommon to find ActionScript developers for whom this is their first taste of programming.</p>
<h3>Our Subject for Today</h3>
<p>One subtle pitfall is the Timer object which is used to run code on a specific time sequence. This class consolidates the setTimeout and setInterval methods. The API is pretty straightforward – create an instance of the class with its delay and repeat count properties, set up listeners which are triggered at the end of each delay or after the number of delays specified by the repeat count are completed, and finally, call the start() method to begin the countdown.</p>
<p>A Timer object is different from other types of objects because the garbage collector does not clear it unless it is stopped, even if there are no active references to it.</p>
<p>Let’s repeat that.</p>
<p><strong>A Timer object is not cleared by the garbage collector as long as it is running, even when its references are set to null or the variable goes out of scope, and it continues to fire TIMER events as long as it is active</strong>.</p>
<p>The only way to clear the object from memory and stop events from being fired is to stop it using the stop() or reset() methods.</p>
<p>The following piece of code illustrates the permanence of Timer objects which haven’t been stopped.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">package 
{
    import flash.display.Sprite;
    import flash.events.Event;
    import flash.events.TimerEvent;
    import flash.utils.Timer;

    public class Main extends Sprite 
    {
        public function Main():void 
        {
             var t:Timer; // Create timer as a local variable

             t = new Timer(1000);
             t.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, this.m_tick);
             t.start(); // Reference ends here; Timer continues to exist and trigger events
        }

        private function m_tick(e:TimerEvent):void
        {
             trace("tick");
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>This may look like a design flaw in the language to the casual passer-by and elicit a very obvious question.</p>
<p>“Everything else is cleared automatically. Why leave behind timers?”</p>
<p>Some thought on the subject will make you realize that the language designers at Adobe weren’t off their rockers after all. This behaviour is by design. In the example code shown above, ‘t’ is a local variable inside the constructor. When the function ends, the variable goes out of scope and<br />
there are no more references to the Timer. If the garbage collector cleared it out, it would not fire any events at all. This would essentially mean that a developer could only assign Timer objects to those variables that remain in scope for as long as it is supposed to run, such as member variables inside a class.</p>
<p>Conversely, a Timer instance which remains active with no way for it to be accessed and stopped is terrible. The object continues to maintain references to listeners and triggers events on them regularly. Listeners can never be garbage collected either because their reference count never goes down to zero. And finally, each active timer occupies a slice of CPU time, bringing the processor down to its knees gradually.</p>
<p>The Timer object always passes a reference to itself in the target property of the TimerEvents it triggers. The listener can use this reference to stop the Timer. When the listener function ends, the event object goes out of scope and is cleared, taking the reference to the Timer object along with it and in turn, making it available for garbage collection.</p>
<p>Here is an example that illustrates how this memory leak can inadvertently occur.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">package 
{
    import flash.events.TimerEvent;
    import flash.utils.Timer;

    public class Slideshow
    {
        private var m_timer:Timer;

        private var m_isActive:Boolean;

        /**
         * Example how not to use a timer
         */
        public function Start():void
        {
             this.m_timer = new Timer(5000); // Create and start a new timer
             this.m_timer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, this.m_next);
             this.m_timer.start();
        }

        private function Pause(e:TimerEvent):void
        {
             this.m_isActive = false;
        }

        private function m_next(e:TimerEvent):void
        {
             if (!this.m_isActive) return;

             // Code to move to next slide
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Slideshow.as</p>
<p>In the example above, the programmer using this slideshow component is expected to call removeChild() to remove it from the stage. However, because the component does not stop the Timer when it is removed, it will continue to fire the TIMER event for as long as the application is run, and also prevent the memory used by the component from being garbage collected by holding a reference to its m_next method. If multiple instances of the slideshow object are created and disposed using removeChild(), their timers will continue to fire and none of the components will actually be cleared from memory.</p>

	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>ActionScript is very well suited to creating old-school demo effects due to its rich drawing API and absence of memory management. Speed would have been a concern a few years ago, but as long as you’re not replicating Heaven7, current releases of Flash player should still be able to handle complex animations with minimal performance problems.</p>
<p>Let me show you a simple wave effect, reminiscing of looking at an object through a wall of water.</p>
<p>Demo effects require a program structure that redraws the entire screen several times every second. The faster the screen refresh, the smoother the resulting animation, at a commensurately higher computation penalty. While traditional languages like C require some kind of a timer mechanism, Flash abstracts away the timers into a frame-rate. We can set up a handler to listen to the ENTER_FRAME event and refresh the screen every time it is triggered.</p>
<p>Demo effects implemented in C often use direct access to the display hardware for performance reasons. Since Flash does not provide direct access to physical devices, we must settle for using the BitmapData class as our drawing buffer and optimize our code within the bounds of its API.</p>
<p>But before we get around to simulating our effect, let us first spend some time understand the principles behind how it is created.</p>
<h3>The Sine Wave</h3>
<p>A sine wave is mathematical function that plots a smooth, repetitive oscillation and is represented in its simplest form as y(t) = A · sin(ωt + Φ) where A is the amplitude or peak deviation of the function from its centre position, ω is the frequency and specifies how many oscillations occur in a unit time interval in radians per second and Φ is the phase, which specifies where the oscillation cycle begins when t = 0.</p>
<p>With this information we can create a simple function to plot a sine wave.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">public function Draw(e:Event):void 
{
    var x1:Number = -1;
    var x2:Number = -1;
    var y1:int = -1;
    var y2:int = -1;
    var amplitude:Number = 120;
    var frequency:Number = 1 * Math.PI / 180; // Convert degree to radians

    for (x1 = 0; x1 &lt; 320; x1++)
    {
        y1 = Math.round(amplitude * Math.sin(frequency * x1)) + 120;
        DrawingUtils.lineBresenham2(this.m_bd, x1, y1, x2, y2, 0xFF000000);
        x2 = x1;
        y2 = y1;
    }
}</pre>
<p><div id="swfaca81">This movie requires Flash Player 9</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
	swfobject.embedSWF("http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wave.swf", "swfaca81", "320", "240", "9.0.0", "", {}, {wmode: "window", menu: "false", quality: "high", bgcolor: "#FFFFFF", allowScriptAccess: "always"}, {});

</p>
<p>We use <a title="Breaking Free from Your API" href="http://www.notadesigner.com/breaking-free-from-your-api/">the Bresenham line drawing algorithm</a> instead of setPixel to plot the curve on the bitmap for better fidelity.</p>
<div id="attachment_176" style="width: 352px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wave-effect-a.jpg" alt="" title="wave-effect-a" width="342" height="302" class="size-full wp-image-176" /><p id="caption-attachment-176" class="wp-caption-text">Image A: The image is taller than the red viewport</p></div>
<h3>Creating Waves with Images</h3>
<p>The same principles can be used to create a wave effect on an image. Instead of plotting points on a canvas, columns of an image are scaled up or down depending upon the shape of the wave. The image is scaled down at points where the wave forms a crest and scaled up wherever the wave forms a trough.</p>
<p>Because of the scaling required, the image we use is larger than the viewable area. Image A illustrates this. The red outline is the viewable area of our movie, whereas the image used is taller than that. If the image is not tall enough you will see white patches at the bottom of the movie when the animation begins.</p>

<p>Each time the screen is to be refreshed, the function cycles over all the columns in the image. The columns are 1 pixel wide in the movie, but for illustration, image B shows the columns as 40 pixels wide. Image C shows how the extracted image column is then scaled down.</p>
<p>When all images are placed next to each other, they appear to make a wave, as shown in image D. While the effect looks very blocky in this illustration due to the wider column widths used, thinner columns used in the final movie give a smoother output.</p>
<p>Further fine-tuning can be done by changing the wavelength of the sine wave. A large value is used in the example below, causing all the columns in the image to shrink and expand at almost the same rate. A smaller value used in its place would have caused a broad discrepancy in the scaling values for each column. Having columns with both large and small values in the same frame would cause a wider range of distortion in the image, and speed up the motion. Effectively, frequency can be used to increase or decrease the speed of the animation, simulating choppy or calm waters as needed.</p>
<p>The function we use is as shown below.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">public function Draw(e:Event):void
{
    var img:int;
    var wd:int;
    var y:Number;
    var mx:Matrix;

    for (y = 0; y &lt; 240; y++)
    {
        img = 0; 
        wd = Math.round(Math.sin(aa) * 20) + 320;
        mx = new Matrix();
        mx.scale(1, wd / 320);

        this.m_bd.draw(this.m_rg[img], mx, null, null, new Rectangle(0, y, 320, 1), true);
        aa += 0.01;
    }

    aa = ab;
    ab += 1 * Math.PI / 180;

<p>The only difference we need to make in our scaffolding code is to call the Draw effect repeatedly when trying to animate the wave effect, whereas drawing the sine wave can be done by calling the function just once on startup.</p>
<p>The entire codebase with both the effects and scaffolding code is <a href='http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/wave-effects.zip'>available for download here</a>. To change the effect shown, change the value of the m_fxName variable in Main.as to either SineWave or WaveEffect. New effects can be added by extending the BaseEffect class and changing the value of the m_fxName variable to the newly created class name.</p>

		<p>Project Euler is a collection of mathematical problems for the programmer who enjoys taxing his brain cells once in a while. The problems are ordered to be successively difficult to solve, which explains why, as of today, 91,510 people have solved problem one, while problem 283 is solved only by 9 people. Not only are they successively more taxing, but going through so many problems itself is a tedious task that requires mental stamina even when taken in installments over several days.</p>
<div class="side-note">
<h3>Understanding the sum of numbers from 1 to N</h3>
<p>Diagram A shows a square with each side 10 units long. A green diagonal cuts the square into two equal triangles. The number of squares making up the square equals 10 x 10 = 100.</p>
<div id="attachment_163" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-163" title="sum-of-numbers-a" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sum-of-numbers-a.png" alt="" width="150" height="149" /><p id="caption-attachment-163" class="wp-caption-text">Diagram A</p></div>
<p>Diagram B shows one half of the triangle, whose base and height are 10 units for a total of 55 cells. The number of cells can be calculated by adding the number of cells in each column, i.e. 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55.</p>
<p>A similar blue triangle is placed above the red triangle in diagram C, in a way that both triangles are touching but do not overlap. Both triangles encompass 55 units and have sides of 10 units each. They combine to make a rectangle that is 10 units wide and 11 units tall. The total number of cells in the rectangle is 55 + 55 = 10 * 11 = 110.</p>
<div id="attachment_164" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-164" title="sum-of-numbers-b" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sum-of-numbers-b.png" alt="" width="150" height="149" /><p id="caption-attachment-164" class="wp-caption-text">Diagram B</p></div>
<p>Thus it can be seen how the total number of cells in one triangle (i.e. N + (N &#8211; 1) + (N &#8211; 2)&#8230;+ 1) can be computed by calculating the area encompassed by a rectangle that is N * (N + 1) and dividing the result by 2.</p>

<p>The good part is that solving a problem helps an individual build an insight that is useful while solving another one later down the line.</p>
<div id="attachment_165" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-165" title="sum-of-numbers-c" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sum-of-numbers-c.png" alt="" width="150" height="158" /><p id="caption-attachment-165" class="wp-caption-text">Diagram C</p></div>
<p>The first problem in Project Euler asks to add all the natural numbers below 1000 which are multiples of 3 or 5. The straightforward way to resolve this is to use a loop from 1 to 999 that uses a modulus operation to evaluate each integer between 1 and 1000 with 3 and 5, adding the ones that are perfectly divisible and discarding the rest.</p>
<p>Here’s an implementation of this code in ActionScript.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">var sum:uint = 0;
for (var i:uint = 1; i &lt; 1000; i++)
    if ((0 == i % 3) || (0 == x % 5)) sum += i;
trace(sum);</pre>
<p>But the secondary goal of these problems is to have an implementation that can return an answer in less than one minute. Problem one is not all that taxing for a modern computer, making even a naïve implementation run well within the required time frame. But complexity for later problems increases exponentially, making the selection of a fast algorithm very essential.</p>
<p>Hence, it is required that one should understand the mathematical principle behind each problem in order to write an efficient solution.</p>
<p>A step-by-step breakdown of the complex, but more efficient solution goes as follows.</p>
<p>The smallest multiple of 3 greater than 1 is 3 itself.</p>
<p>The largest multiple of 3 less than 1000 can be computed easily.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">multiples = (1000 - 1) / 3
multiples = 333.33
multiples = floor(remainder)
multiples = 333</pre>
<p>The floor() function is used to discard the decimal part of the result by mapping the real number into the previous smallest integer.</p>
<p>The result, 333, is the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 1000. So the sum of these values can be computed by adding the multiples together.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">(1 * 3) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 3)...+ (333 * 3)
= 3 (1 + 2 + 3...333)</pre>
<p>The sum of numbers between 1 and n is n (n + 1) / 2. So the sum of 1 to 333 is 333 (333 + 1) / 2, which is 55,611. Multiplying that by 3 gives you 166,833, which is the sum of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 1000.</p>
<p>The same method can be used to compute the sum of multiples of 5 between 1 and 1,000, to get a result of 99,500.</p>
<p>The problem asks to compute the sum of multiples of 3 or 5. What we have done so far is compute the sum of multiples of 3 and 5. To remove the overlap between the two sets, compute the least common multiple of the two numbers, which is 15, and calculate the sum of multiples of that number between 1 and 1000. Subtracting that set from the first two will result in a set which contains numbers which are either multiples of 3 or 5 but not both.</p>
<p>The same principle also applies when the sum of multiples of 15 is deducted from the sum of multiples of 3 plus the sum of multiples of 5.</p>
<p>So your final solution is sumOfMultiples(3) + sumOfMultiples(5) &#8211; sumOfMultiples(15).</p>
<p>The complete implementation of the program is as follows.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">package 
{
    import flash.display.Sprite;

    /**
     * Project Euler solutions entry point
     */
    public class Main extends Sprite 
    {
        public function Main():void 
        {
            var p:IProblem = new Problem1();
            trace(p.solve());
        }
    }
}

package  
{
    /**
     * If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are
     * multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum
     * of these multiples is 23.
     * 
     * Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
     */
    public class Problem1 implements IProblem
    {
        public function solve():uint
        {
            var limit:uint = 999;
            trace((sumOfMultiples(3, limit) + sumOfMultiples(5, limit)) - sumOfMultiples(15, limit));
        }

        private function sumOfMultiples(factor:uint, limit:uint):uint
        {
            return factor * sum1toN(limit / factor);
        }

        private function sum1toN(n:uint):uint
        {
            return Math.round((n * (n + 1)) / 2);
        }
    }

	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I leapt headfirst into multimedia development a decade ago, there was just one go-to product for all interactive needs – Macromedia Director. With origins in the vastly successful MacroMind VideoWorks application, Director had a strong pedigree in multimedia production. Regular updates of the product over more than a decade had converted the original VideoWorks into a development environment with an object-oriented programming language of its own called Lingo. It also supported external plug-ins for added features, ran on Windows and Macintosh computers and supported all media formats of the day – plain text, images, sound and video. The greatest plus point of Director was its ability to create a projector out of the Director file, which was an executable file that bundled the player and the binary file along with any plugins that were used. The projector was guaranteed to work on any system without requiring any additional libraries (except maybe audio and video codecs).</p>
<h3>A new age, a new champion</h3>
<p>Then the whole web thing happened and Director could not keep pace any more. Macromedia shipped Xtras to support more media formats such as hypertext and Flash, and to make network requests. They also shipped the Shockwave browser plug-in to run a Director file in the browser. But it was no match for the Flash plug-in, which was a fraction of the download. This weighed heavily in the dial-up era back then. Chinks in the development environment began to take their toll. The biggest flaw of Director was that it bundled media and scripts in its working file into a single binary blob and saved it to disk. This meant that version control tools could not diff the scripts against previous revisions. Developers could not collaborate and work upon the same project without leaping through significant loops. The files would sometimes get damaged and become unreadable if there were power failures or other system breakdowns while the file was being saved. There was no easy way to create and reuse libraries. And the eccentric syntax of the Lingo language was a black mark on its developers, who could never gain any repute among people who used ‘real’ programming languages with curly braces.</p>
<p>When Flash began to gain a foothold in the market because of its reach and ease of use, multimedia developers began to move on to the new platform in a steady trickle over the years, until Director became a niche production environment. The situation gave Macromedia a chance to right the problems of Director on a new platform, blank as a clean slate. And they capitalized upon it in a stellar manner. ActionScript quickly morphed from a simple scripting language with a handful of constructs, to a full-blown development environment that supported complex object hierarchies, most OOP principles, a rich API for various tasks ranging from media control to network access, all packaged inside a runtime that was tiny and already available on most of the internet-enabled computers. And it had curly braces.</p>
<h3>A web of entanglement</h3>
<p>Yet, the biggest drawback of Flash was its sandbox that prevented developers from doing anything beyond the boundaries of the browser. Local file system access was out. Native nested windows were out. Drag and drop was not available. Launching native processes was out. Projector files were slightly more forgiving and allowed read-only local file access and limited spawning of new processes. But this was nowhere close to the unrestricted freedom offered by Director projectors. This in itself was not bad most of the time. But when more serious functionality was needed, ActionScript developers had to depend upon another programming language to get the job done. To be fair, Macromedia, and now Adobe have always done their best to make cross-language interop as easy as possible. We have come a long way from the getURL() calls required in ActionScript 1 to today’s ExternalInterface API. But a dependency meant having to support yet another codebase.</p>
<h3>Breaking free</h3>
<p>It was heartening then to hear of the Adobe AIR announcement some years ago. Finally, Flash applications could be written to take advantage of local facilities of the system along with the existing media and internet API’s. It was now possible to read and write local files in a meaningful manner. Network utilities could be a lot more proactive and efficient. Applications could update themselves transparently and could support richer desktop paradigms such as taskbar icons and drag-and-drop interactions.</p>
<p>There still isn’t complete unfettered access to the system, the way Director projectors could. But this limitation will remain due to the different security scenario today. Being able to sell AIR as a secure replacement for web applications is highly desirable for Adobe in the face of HTML 5 and the advancing capabilities of browsers. But combined with all the other benefits that Flash offers, along with the reduced development time over other desktop development environments, and instant cross-platform compatibility, this is an insignificant bump.</p>
<p>The only drawback that AIR has over Director is that it requires a separate download of the AIR runtime. At 11 MB, it does not add a significant cost in today’s age. But it is a deal breaker for users without administrative rights. There really should be a way to package the runtime and the application package into a single executable.</p>
<h3>HTML is not the only future</h3>
<p>There still are naysayers who predict that the Flash platform is dead. All that is needed is wider acceptance and support for HTML 5. But with support for HTML and JavaScript built into AIR (with WebKit, no less), Adobe already has that base covered. And the web is not the do-all and end-all of computing. While having a social networking application online makes sense, personal accounting or mail applications are better kept locally for security and accessibility reasons. And desktop applications have the unique ability to morph into hybrids that work locally as well as with remote services, which is better in some cases than having a web-only application. Most people already use a hybrid application – their mail client. New mails can be downloaded and read when connected online, while still being able to access downloaded emails when working offline.</p>
<p>Sure the W3C is working on writing specifications for similar functionality with HTML 5. But who said choice is bad? Given the sorry state of browser standardization even today, it is more likely that each browser publisher will implement the spec in some half-assed manner that causes subtle differences between them and require someone to invent a shim to fix those incompatibilities. And HTML 5 does not address all the features that AIR supports, including hardware accelerated 3D and filter effects, native menus, file extension registration, drag and drop, advanced sound and video API’s and windowing support beyond the most rudimentary.</p>
<p>In spite of all the advantages that it has, AIR has failed to make major inroads into desktop development. Blame lies squarely on Adobe for failing to promote it well enough. Other than ActionScript developer circles, there rarely is any mention or knowledge of the platform. They really ought to pick up some steam on that front and corner the market the way Director and Flash have done in their time.</p>
