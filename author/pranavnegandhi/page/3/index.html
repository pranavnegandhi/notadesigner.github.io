	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		
<p>The purpose of the state design pattern is to allow an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes.</p>



<p>The example of a logging function below is a model candidate for conversion into a state implementation.</p>



<p>The requirements of this function are as follows.</p>



<ol><li>Write the log entry to the end of a text file by default.</li><li>The file size is unlimited by default, denoted by setting the value of the maximum file size to 0.</li><li>If the value of the maximum file size is greater than 0 then the log file is archived when it reaches this size, and the entry is written to a new empty log file.</li><li>If the recycle attribute is enabled and the maximum file size is set to a value greater than 0, then the oldest entry in the log file is erased to make space for the new entry instead of archiving the entire log file.</li></ol>



<p>The implementation of the actual mechanism for writing to disk is not relevant in this example. Rather, the focus is on creating a framework that enables selecting the correct mechanism based on the preferences set.</p>


<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
public void Log(string message)
{
    if (LimitSize)
    {
        if (file.Length &lt; MAX_SIZE)
        {
            // Write to the end of the log file
        }
        else
        {
            if (Recycle)
            {
                // Clear room at the top of the log file
            }
            else
            {
                // Create a new log file with current time stamp
            }

            // Write to the end of the log file
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // Write to the end of the log file
    }
}
</pre>


<p>The implementation shown above is very naïve, tightly coupled, rigid and brittle. However, it is also a fairly common occurrence in most code bases due to its straightforward approach to addressing the problem.</p>



<p>The complicated logical structure is difficult to decipher, debug and extend. The tasks of determining file size limits, recovering disk space, creating a new file and writing to the file are all discrete from each other and should have no dependency between themselves. But they are all interwoven in this approach and add a huge cognitive overhead in order to understand the execution path.</p>



<p>There are multiple conditions being evaluated before the log entry is made. The programmer has to simulate the computer’s own execution path for each statement before even arriving at the important lines related to writing to disk. A couple of blocks are duplicated code. It would be nice if the execution path could be streamlined and duplicate code removed.</p>



<h3>Restructured Code </h3>



<p>
An eager approach to selecting the preferred mechanism breaks up the conditional statements into manageable chunks. It is logically no different from having the same code in the Log method. But moving it into the mutator makes it easier to understand by adding context into the logic rather than handing it all in a single giant function.

</p>


<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
public int MaxFileSize
{
    get
    {
        return _maxFileSize;
    }

    set
    {
        _maxFileSize = value;

        if (0 == MaxFileSize)
        {
            // Activate the unlimited logger
            return;
        }

        if (Recycle)
        {
            // Activate the recycling logger
        }
        else
        {
            // Activate the rotating logger
        }
    }
}

public bool Recycle
{
    get
    {
        return _recycle;
    }

    set
    {
        _recycle = value;

        if (0 == MaxFileSize)
        {
            // Recycling is not applicable when file sizes are unlimited
            return;
        }

        if (Recycle)
        {
            // Activate the recycling logger
        }
        else
        {
            // Activate the rotating logger
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
The comments indicate that you’re still missing some code that actually performs the operation. This is the spot where the behaviour is selected and applied based on the state of the object. We use C# delegates to alter the behaviour of the object at runtime.

</p>


<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
public delegate void LogDelegate(Level level, string statement)

public LogDelegate Log
{
    get;
    private set;
}
</pre>


<p>
The Logger class contains private methods that implement the same signature as the Log delegate.

</p>


<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
private void AppendAndLog(Level level, string message)
{
}

private void RotateAndLog(Level level, string message)
{
}

private void RecycleAndLog(Level level, string message)
{
}
</pre>


<p>
When the condition evaluation is completed and the logging method has to be selected, a new instance of the Log delegate is created which points to the correct logging method.

</p>


<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
if (Recycle)
{
    Log = new LogDelegate(RecycleAndLog);
}
else
{
    Log = new LogDelegate(RotateAndLog);
}
</pre>


<p>
This separates the selection of the correct logging technique to use from the implementation of the technique itself. The logging method implementations can be changed at will to fix bugs or extend their features without adding risk to breaking the rest of the code.

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>No matter how far technology progresses, it seems that we still remain bound to the past by an innate ability of writing poorly structured programs. To me, this points to a rot that is far deeper than languages and platforms. It is a fundamental failure of people who claim to be professionals to understand their tools and the principles that guide their usage.</p>
<p>It has been eight years since I wrote <a href="/how-to-write-unmaintainable-code-php-redux">the previous piece in this series that demonstrated poorly written PHP code</a>. The language gets a bad rap due to the malpractices that abound among users of the platform. But this was a theme I was hoping would be left behind after graduating to the .NET framework in the past few years.</p>
<p>It turns out that I was wrong. Bad programmers will write bad code irrespective of the language or platform that is offered to them. And the most shocking bit is that so many of the points from the previous article (and the original by Roedy Green) are still applicable, that it feels like we learned nothing at all.</p>
<h3>Reinvent the wheel again. Poorly.</h3>
<p>Maintainable code adheres to standards – industry, platform, semantics, or just simply internal to the company. Standard practices make it easy to build, maintain and extend software. As such, they’re anathema to anybody who aims to exclude newcomers from modifying his program.</p>
<p>Therefore, ignore standards.</p>
<p>Take the case of date and time. It is 2018, and people want to and expect to be able to use any software product irrespective of their personal regional settings.</p>
<p>Be merciless in thrashing their expectations. Tailor your product to work exclusively with the regional settings used on your development computer. If you are using the American date format, say you’re paying homage to the original home of the PC. If you’re using British settings, extol upon the semantic benefits of the dd-mm-yy structure over the unintelligible American format.</p>
<p>Modern programming platforms have a dedicated date and time data type precisely to avoid this problem. Sidestep it by transmitting and storing dates as strings in your preferred formats (there doesn’t have to be just one). That way, you also get to scatter a 200-line snippet of code to parse and extract individual fields from the string.</p>
<p>For extra points, close all bug reports about the issue from the test engineers with a “Works for me” comment. Your development computer is the ultimate benchmark for your software. Everybody who wishes to run your program should aspire to replicate the immaculate state of existence of your computer. They have no business running or modifying your program otherwise.</p>
<p>Never acknowledge the presence of alternative universal standards.</p>
<h3>Ignorance is bliss</h3>
<p>Nobody writes raw C# code if they are going to deploy on the web. A standard deployment of ASP.NET contains significant amounts of framework libraries that enable the web pipeline and extensions to work with popular third-party tools. Frameworks in the ecosystem are a programming language unto themselves, and require training before use.</p>
<p>Skip the books and dive into writing code headfirst.</p>
<p>Write your own code from scratch to do everything from form handling to error logging. Only n00bs use frameworks. Real programmers write their own frameworks to work inside of frameworks. This gives rise to brilliant nuggets such as this.</p>
<pre>public class FooController
{
    …
    public new void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
    {
    }
    …
}</pre>
<p>By essentially reinventing the framework, you are the master of your destiny and that of the company that you are working for. Each line of custom-built code that you write to replace the standard library tightens your chokehold on their business, and makes you irreplaceable.</p>
<h3>Allow unsanitised input</h3>
<p>Protecting from SQL injection is difficult and requires constant vigilance. If everything is open to injection, the maintenance programmer will be bogged under the sheer volume of things to repair and hopefully, either go away or be denied permission to fix it due to lack of meaningful effort estimates.</p>
<p>Mask these shortcomings by only writing client-side validation. That way, the bugs remain hidden until the day some script kiddie uses the contact form on the site to send “; DELETE TABLE Users” to your server.</p>
<h3>Try…catch…swallow</h3>
<p>Nobody wants to see those ugly-ass “Server Error” pages in the browser. So do the most obvious thing and wrap your code in a try-catch block. But write only one catch handler for the most general exception possible. Then leave it empty.</p>
<p>This becomes doubly difficult to diagnose if you still return something which looks like a meaningful response, but is actually utterly incorrect. For example, if your method is supposed to return a JSON object for the active record, return a mock object from the error handler which looks like the real thing. But populate it with empty or completely random values. Leave some of the values correct to avoid making it too obvious.</p>
<p>Maintenance programmers have no business touching your code if they do not have an innate ken for creating perfect conditions where errors do not occur.</p>
<h3>String up performance</h3>
<p>Fundamental data types such as strings and numbers are universal. Especially strings. Therefore, store all your data as strings, including obvious numeric entities such as record identifiers.</p>
<p>This strategy has even more potential when working with complex data types containing multiple data fields. Eschew standard schemes such as CSV. Instead come up with your own custom scheme using uncommonly used text characters. The Unicode standard is very vast. I personally recommend using pips from playing cards. The “♥” character is appropriately labelled “Black Heart Suit”, because it lets the maintenance programmer perceive the hatred you bear towards him for attempting to tarnish the pristine beauty of the code you have so lovingly written.</p>
<p>This technique also has a lot of potential in the database. Storing numeric data as strings increases the potential for writing custom parsers or making type-casts mandatory before the data can be used.</p>
<h3>Use the global scope</h3>
<p>Global variables are one of the fundamental arsenal in the war against maintainable code. Never fail an opportunity to use them.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a prime environment for unleashing them upon the unwary maintenance programmer. Every variable that is not explicitly wrapped up inside a function automatically becomes accessible to all other code being loaded on that page. This is an increasingly rare scenario with modern languages. The closest it can be approximated in C# is to have a global class with several public properties which are referenced directly all over the application. While it looks the same, it is still highly insulated. Try these snippets as an example.</p>
<p>JavaScript –</p>
<pre>var a = 0; // Variable a declared in global scope

function doFoo() {
    a++; // Modifies the variable in global scope
}

function doBar() {
    var a = 1;
    a++; // Modifies the variable in local scope
}</pre>
<p>C# –</p>
<pre>public class AppGlobals
{
    public int A = 0;
}

public class Foo
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        // Scope of A is abundantly clear
        AppGlobals.A++;
        var A = 0;
        A++;
    }
}</pre>
<p>It is very easy to overlook the scope of the variable in JavaScript if the method is lengthy. Use it to your advantage. Camouflage any attempts to detect the scope correctly by using different conventions across the application. Modify the global variable in some functions. Define and use local variables with the same name in others. Modifying a function must require extensive meditation upon it first. Maintenance programmers must achieve a state of Zen and become one with your code in order to change it.</p>
<h3>Use unconventional data types</h3>
<p>Libraries often leverage the use of conventions to eliminate the need to write custom code. For example, the Entity Framework can automatically handle table per type conditions if the primary key column in the base class is an identity column.</p>
<p>You can sideline this feature by using string or UUID columns as primary keys. Columns with these data types cannot be marked as identity. This necessitates writing custom code to operate upon the data entities. As you must be aware by now, every extra line of code is invaluable.</p>
<h3>Database tables without relationships</h3>
<p>If you are working at a small organisation, chances are there is no dedicated database administrator role and developers manage their own database. Take advantage of this lack of oversight and build tables without any relationships or meaningful constraints. Extra points if you can pull it off with no primary keys or indexes.</p>
<p>Combine this with the practice of creating and leaving several unwanted tables with similar names to give rise to a special kind of monstrosity that nobody has the courage to deal with. For still extra marks, perform updates in all the tables, including the dead ones. Fetch it from different tables in different parts of the application. They cannot be called unwanted tables if even one part of your application depends on them. Call it “sharding” if anybody questions your design.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This post is not meant to trigger language wars. Experienced developers have seen bad code written in many languages. Some languages are just more amenable to poor practices than others.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the .NET framework, which was supposed to be a clean break from the monstrosities of the past. On the web, the ASP.NET framework and its associated libraries are still one of the best environments I have used to build applications.</p>
<p>That people still write badly structured code in spite of all these advances cements my original point – bad programmers write bad code irrespective of the language thrown at them.</p>

		<p><a href="https://medium.com/@bartobri/hash-crash-the-basics-of-hash-tables-bef82a8ea550">Brian Barto recently put up a post</a> where he described how hash tables are implemented. Many modern programming languages have this data structure as a built-in feature, making it a commonly used item in a developer’s toolkit. Due to its ready availability, few programmers ever have the need to roll their implementation. So it comes as no surprise when people who do not have a formal education in software engineering do not understand how it works. Brian&#8217;s post explains the most essential parts of this magical data structure very well.</p>
<p>After reading about it, I felt the urge to implement the same thing in C# as a learning experience. His post carries an implementation using the C programming language, which could be copied over with some tweaking in order to work with the different semantics of C#. This post documents the exercise and its learnings.</p>
<h3>The Associative Array</h3>
<p>A hash table is an implementation of an associative array, which is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and can appear only once in the collection. The data structure supports the full range of CRUD operations &#8211; create, retrieve, update and delete. All operations are constant time on average or linear time in the worst case, making speed the main advantage of this data structure. In some languages, all operations are rolled into the same operator for simplicity. If the key does not exist, it is added. If the key already exists in the collection, its value is overwritten with the new one. Keys are removed by setting their value to null, or having a separate delete operator for associative arrays.</p>
<p>JavaScript objects are an example of associative arrays.</p>
<pre>var o = { “name”: “John Doe” };<br>o[“occupation”] = “Wizard”; // Key created<br>o[“name”] = “Jane Doe”; // Key updated<br>console.log(o[“name”]); // Value retrieval<br>delete o[“occupation”]; // Jane just retired</pre>
<p>A hash table uses a linear array internally to store values. The key is converted into an integer by running it through a hash function, which is then used as the index into the backing array where the value is stored. A good hash function has two characteristics – <strong>minimal conflicts</strong> and <strong>uniform distribution</strong>.</p>
<h4>Minimal Conflicts</h4>
<p>As explained above, a hash function works by converting an input into an integer. A modular hash function is one of the simplest implementations possible, which returns the remainder of a division (aka modulo) of the key by the table length.</p>
<pre>int size = 100;<br>int key = 10;<br>int index = key % size; // 10</pre>
<p>However, this function can end up with a high number of conflicts. The remainder of dividing 10, 110, 210 and so on are are all 10, and require additional steps to resolve the conflict. This condition is minimised by setting the length of the array to a prime number.</p>
<pre>int size = 97;<br>int key = 10;<br>int index = key % size; // 10<br>key = 110;<br>index = key % size; // 13<br>key = 210;<br>index = key % size; // 16</pre>
<h4>Uniform Distribution</h4>
<p>Discrete uniform distribution is a statistical term for a condition where all values in a finite set all have an equal probability of being observed. A uniform distribution of hash values over the indexes into an array reduces the possibilities of key conflict, and reduces the cost of frequent conflict resolution. Uniform distribution over an arbitrary set of keys is a difficult mathematical challenge, and I won’t even pretend to understand what I’m talking about. Let it just suffice that a lot of really smart folks have already worked on that and we get to build upon their achievements.</p>
<p>If the keys in a hash table belong to a known and finite set (such as a language dictionary), then the developer can write what is known as a perfect hash function that provides an even distribution of hashes with zero conflicts.</p>
<h4>Resolving Conflicts</h4>
<p>Finally, general purpose hash functions can often result in conflicts, i.e. return the same output for two separate inputs. In this case, the hash table must resolve the conflict. For example, the modular hash function returns the index 13 for the key 13 as well as 110. There must be a way to set both these keys simultaneously in the same collection. Broadly, there are three techniques to achieve this.</p>
<p>Separate Chaining</p>
<p>In this technique, the values themselves are not stored in the array. They are stored in a separate data structure such as a linked list, and a pointer or reference to that list is stored in the backing array. When a value is to be located, the function first computes its index by hashing the key, then walks through the list associated with that index until it finds the desired key-value pair.</p>
<p>Open Addressing</p>
<p>Open addressing stores all records in the array itself. When a new value is to be inserted, its index position is computed by applying the hash function on the key. If the desired position is occupied, then the rest of the positions are probed. There are several probing algorithms also. Linear probing, the simplest of them, requires walking the array in fixed increments from the desired index until an empty spot is found in the array.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Enough theory. Let us move on to implementation details.</p>
<p>The first step is to define a HashTable class. The size of the hash table is restricted to 100 entries for this exercise and a fixed-length array is initialised to store these entries.</p>
<pre>public class HashTable
{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private static readonly int SIZE = 100;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private object[] _entries = new object[SIZE];
}</p></pre>
<p>This is where the implementation of this data structure veers away from the one shown in Brian Barto&#8217;s post. The original post used explicitly named method for insert, search and delete operations. However, C# allows the nicer and more intuitive use of a square-bracket syntax to perform these same operations.</p>
<pre>public class HashTable<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
    public int this[int key]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get;<br>        set;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
}</pre>
<p>The client program uses the following syntax to consume this interface, which is much more concise than having separate methods for each operation.</p>
<pre>HashTable map = new HashTable();
map[key] = value; // Insert
int value = map[key]; Retrieve
map[key] = null; // Delete</pre>
<p>The HashTable class internally uses a struct called Entry to store individual key-value pairs.</p>
<pre>struct Entry
{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internal int key;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internal int? value;
}</pre>
<p>The type of the value field in the Entry struct must be set to a nullable int so that the client can set it to null when the value has to be cleared. The declaration of the _entries field is changed as follows.</p>
<pre>private Entry?[] _entries = new Entry?[HashTable.SIZE];</pre>
<p>Finally, we come to the meat and potatoes of this exercise &#8211; the accessor &amp; mutator functions, whose signature is also modified to support the nullable type.</p>
<pre>public int? this[int key]
{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
}</pre>
<p>The code for these methods and the hash function is more or less identical to the one described in Brian&#8217;s post, with some tweaks to accommodate for the nullable value.</p>
<pre>get
{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int index = _hash(key);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (null != _entries[index])<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (key == _entries[index]?.key)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; index = (index + 1) % HashTable.SIZE;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
<br>    return _entries[index]?.value;
}<br><br>set
{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (null == value)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _delete(key);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int index = _hash(key);
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (null != _entries[index])<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (key == _entries[index]?.key)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; index = (index + 1) % HashTable.SIZE;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _entries[index] = new HashEntry { key = key, value = value };<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
}</p></pre>
<p>The one additional member in this class is the private _delete method which is required to delete the entry. This method is called by the mutator function when the client passes in a null value.</p>
<pre>private void _delete(int key)
{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int index = _hash(key);<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (null != _entries[index])<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (key == _entries[index]?.key)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; index = (index + 1) % HashTable.SIZE;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (null == _entries[index])<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _entries[index] = null;
}</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s all that&#8217;s needed to implement this data structure. The hash function shown in this example is a very naïve implementation. The probability of collisions is very high and the probing function is very slow. It also cannot work with any data type other than int for both keys and their values.</p>
<p>In spite of these limitations, this still made for a very useful learning exercise.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Many features like automatic memory management have made modern programming technically easier. But pesky business requirements still remain a formidable challenge. A large portion of the complexity in modern applications originates from ever-evolving business rules. In an ideal scenario, there would be no functional requirements and programmers would be paid directly in Cheetos and Mountain Dew for doing cool stuff all day. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not the case, and all payments must be made in fiat currency rather than snacks. So a business is necessary in order to generate revenue. And with it come its own requirements for things like processes, regulations and laws.</p>
<p style="transition: transform 1s;">In spite of this, a smart programmer can notice that the application of rules to a process is easily separated from the rules themselves. They can be applied in linear sequence or driven by outcomes of its component steps (such as offering the customer a choice between cash discounts or adding complimentary products instead). Linear processing is straightforward to implement – execute each step in a queue one at a time until they are all done. Conditional processing depends on the outcome of the previous step, making the workflow a gigantic mishmash of if-else statements if not handled carefully from the start.</p>
<p>Both types of processing can incorporate structures such as loops, sub-routines and interrupts.</p>
<p>This post demonstrates an implementation of a sequential workflow where the process pipeline is separated from the steps in the process. This architecture allows for the execution of the pipeline to remain unchanged even if the steps in the process change.</p>
<p>The workflow model constitutes of the entities described below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-947" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/class-diagram-788x600.png" alt="Sequential Workflow Execution" width="788" height="600" srcset="https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/class-diagram-788x600.png 788w, https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/class-diagram-768x585.png 768w, https://notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/class-diagram.png 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<p>Activities are the steps which must be performed in a workflow. The type <strong>IActivity&lt;TParameter&gt;</strong> defines the common minimum standard that all activities must implement. It requires a method called Execute which takes one parameter.</p>
<pre>void Execute(TParameter parameter)</pre>
<p>The parameter is the input that this activity may require. Its type should match the type specified in the concrete constructor of this interface. Consuming the Sequence class is easy if this is a reference type. The client simply has to call its Execute method and wait for it to return. The modifications will show up in the input instance that the client already has. But if it is a value type, the the caller has to subscribe for the ExecuteCompleted event from the Sequence, whose handler receives the modified value as a parameter.</p>
<p>The IActivity&lt;TParameter&gt; type exposes an ExecuteCompleted event. The Sequencer must subscribe to this event in order to be notified when the activity completes its execution successfully. The event delegate receives a parameter of type ExecuteCompletedEventArgs. The Result property of this instance contains the modified value of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Activity&lt;TParameter&gt;</strong> is an abstract class that provides a minimal implementation of the IActivity interface. Derived classes which override the Execute method must ensure that the method in the base class is called, or otherwise ensure that the OnExecuteCompleted method is called when the method completes successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Sequence&lt;TParameter&gt;</strong> is the primary execution path of the workflow. It lets the client add activities to the workflow and execute them in the order that they were added.</p>
<p>The Sequence class stores the activity class instances in a queue. It uses an enumerator to ratchet through the list. The enumerator points to the first activity instance and executes it. The Sequence class subscribes to the ExecuteCompleted event from the Activity instance, which causes the enumerator to move to the next activity in the list and execute it. This process continues until all the activities in the list have been executed. At this point, the Sequence itself dispatches the ExecuteCompleted event, which the client must subscribe to.</p>
<p>The Sequence class exposes the following methods.</p>
<pre>void Add(IActivity&lt;TParameter&gt; activity)
</pre>
<p>This method accepts an IActivity instance, whose generic parameter must match the generic type of the Sequence class instance itself.</p>
<pre style="transition: transform 1s;">public void Execute(TParameter input)</pre>
<p>This method triggers the execution of the Sequence. It takes a single parameter of the type declared in TParameter. This input is passed as a parameter to the Execute method of all the Activity instances in the sequence.</p>
<p>Activities are further classified into filters and transformations. A filter scans the input and either allows or disallows further processing. It does not modify the input in any manner. A transformation activity modifies the input in some way and returns the modified value as output. In the case of the former, there needs to be a mechanism to signal a break in the process to the client. For this, the activity must throw a <strong>ExecuteException</strong>. The client of the Sequence class must wrap the call to the Execute method in a try block and handle any failure to complete the process in the catch block.</p>
<p>These types are collectively sufficient to provide the framework for any simple linear workflow. However, the actual steps to be performed are not part of the framework. The client must provide the concrete implementations of the Activity class, one for each step in the process. These classes are instantiated and added to the Sequence class.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The following section demonstrates how a transformation and a filter can be implemented and consumed by this framework.</p>
<p>Classes which derive from Activity are part of the client implementation and must be stored in the client namespace. In this example we use the Notadesigner.Text namespace to implement a HyperlinkTransformation and a DeDupFilter.</p>
<p><strong>HyperlinkTransformation</strong> scans the input string for any sequences that begin with http:// or https:// and wraps it within an anchor tag. This example uses a very simple RegEx sequence to perform this step. We are not really interested in the versatility of the regex for this throwaway example.</p>
<pre style="transition: transform 1s;">public class HyperlinkTransformation : Activity&lt;string&gt;
{
    void Execute(string input)
    {
        RegEx.Replace(input, @"http(s)?://[a-z.]+");
        base.Execute(input);
    }
}

…
var activity = new HyperlinkTransformation();
activity.ExecuteCompleted += (sender, e)
{
    Console.WriteLine{"Result {0}", e.Result);
};
activity.Execute("Visit http://www.notadesigner.com for best deals in programming snippets.");
…</pre>
<p>When the Execute method completes, it dispatches the ExecuteCompleted event.</p>
<p><strong>DeDupFilter</strong> compares the string with existing values in the database. If it is a duplicate, then the previous string is maintained as is and the new one is discarded. This is achieved by throwing a SequenceException from the Execute method of this class if an existing match is found.</p>
<pre>public class DeDupFilter : Activity&lt;string&gt;
{
    void Execute(string input)
    {
        // CurrentEntries is of type List&lt;string&gt; and is populated previously with string entries
        if (CurrentEntries.IndexOf(input) &gt; -1)
        {
            throw new ExecuteException("Entry already exists");
        }
    }
}

…
try
{
    var activity = new DeDupFilter();
    activity.Execute("Talk is cheap. Show me the code.");
}
catch (SequenceException)
{
    Trace.TraceError("Entry already exists");
}
…</pre>
<p>The client can then handle the exception and proceed with the understanding the input being inserted was already present in the database.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The previous installment in the Building FitNet series explained how to connect a view-model with a view, using a modular and extensible architecture. In this episode, I explain how interactivity can be added to the user interface.</p>
<p>The simplest interactive UI control is a button. You click on it, and it executes some action. Buttons in Windows Forms worked the same way. But WPF takes the button and turns the knob up to 11. Buttons in WPF can take on literally any appearance that you can dream of. Building the user interface using XAML is already so much better than using the Designer or literal code statements. Features such as data binding are added bonus and allow for more dynamism in the user interface. You can bind the appearance of a Button instance to a view-model that reacts to the state of the application and literally make things dance.</p>
<p>The change in architecture also extends to the use of the event handlers. The built-in System.Windows.Controls.Button class has a property called Command, which can be bound to the view-model of the instance. The Command property is of type System.Windows.Input.ICommand. Any class that implements this interface can be attached to this property.</p>
<p>This sounds a bit counterintuitive at first. Why have a special type, when a simple function can suffice?</p>
<p>And the answer is separation of concerns. A command decouples the object that invokes the command from the object that executes the command.</p>
<p>The ICommand interface also provides additional properties that make it easy to control the state of the button with a bit of additional code.</p>
<pre>public class RelayCommand : ICommand<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public RelayCommand(Action execute, Func&lt;bool&gt; canExecute)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; …<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _execute = execute;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _canExecute = canExecute;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; event EventHandler ICommand.CanExecuteChanged<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Event dispatched event when the state of the CanExecute property changes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; …<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool ICommand.CanExecute(object parameter)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return null == _canExecute ? true : _canExecute();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void ICommand.Execute(object parameter)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _execute();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>}</pre>
<p>The Command property of the button is assigned an instance of RelayCommand. This class constructor takes two parameters – an Action delegate called execute and a Func&lt;bool&gt; delegate called canExecute. The Action is called when the command is to be executed, whereas the Func&lt;bool&gt; determines if the command can be executed at all or not.</p>
<p>This is useful for performing runtime checks on the validity of input. The CanExecute delegate is triggered automatically by the framework periodically, which keeps the state of the button updated at all times.</p>
<p>The Command object should be made available through the view-model so that the button can be bound to it.</p>
<pre>public class CalculatorViewModel<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public CalculatorViewModel()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TryCalculateCommand = new RelayCommand(TryCalcuate, CanTryCalculate);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public ICommand TryCalculateCommand<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private set;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private void TryCalcuate()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private bool CanTryCalculate()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Validate the input fields and return a boolean<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>}</pre>
<p>That’s it! All that’s left is to bind the Command property of the Button instance to the TryCalculateCommand property in the view-model.</p>
<pre>&lt;Button Content="Calculate" Command="{Binding TryCalculateCommand}"/&gt;</pre>
<p>Collectively, these minor improvements in paradigm make WPF a much nicer framework to use over its predecessors.</p>

		<p>It turns out that there is a much better way to manipulate the user interface in WPF which is based on view-models. I cover this aspect in this episode of Building FitNet.</p>
<p>The System.Windows.Application class is the core of a WPF program. An instance of this class remains in memory for as long as the application is running. In order for the application to do something useful, programmers must extend this class and customise its behaviour to the needs of their own application. By convention, the primary application window is also instantiated by this class in the OnStartup event handler.</p>
<pre>private ShellViewModel _shellViewModel;

override public void OnStartup(StartupEventArgs e)
{
  base.OnStartup(e);
  _shellViewModel = new ShellViewModel();

  var window = new Shell();
  window.DataContext = _shellViewModel;
  window.Show();
}</pre>
<p>An instance of the ShellViewModel class is assigned as the view-model for the application window through its DataContext property. When the properties in the view-model instance change, it dispatches a PropertyChanged event along with the name of the changed property. Corresponding event handlers in the window object then query the view-model for the new state and update the appearance of the display. The ShellViewModel class must implement the System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged interface for this behaviour.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates this by changing the title of the application window.</p>
<pre>public class ShellViewModel
{
  …
  public string Title
  {
   get
   {
     return _title;
   }

   set
   {
      _title = value;
     var e = new PropertyChangedEventArgs(“Title”);
     PropertyChanged(this, e);
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>Specific properties of the view are bound to their corresponding counterparts in the view-model. In this example, the Title property of the Window class is bound to its namesake in the view-model.</p>
<pre>&lt;Window … Title=”{Binding Path=Title}&gt;
  …
&lt;/Window&gt;</pre>
<p>Therefore, when the title changes on the view-model, the change gets reflected on the view. The key here is assigning an instance of the ShellViewModel to the DataContext property, which establishes the bindings between the view and the view-model.</p>
<p>This concept is key to understanding and implementing properly architected WPF applications.</p>
<h4>Binding On-Screen Views</h4>
<p>This concept of binding a view to data can be extended to any type. Primitive types are rendered as strings. For complex types, programmers can build composite views made up of several different fundamental UI elements such as labels, text fields and buttons. Properties in the view-model are bound to these controls.</p>
<p>In order to render the content in the window, the application must instantiate ContentControl, which is shipped along with WPF. This class has a property called Content, which can be bound to any property in the view-model.</p>
<pre>&lt;ContentControl Content="{Binding Title}"/&gt;</pre>
<p>The output of the program written so far is shown below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/view.binding.demonstration.png" alt="A string binding between a view-model and a view" width="656" height="438" /></p>
<p>When the value of Title in the view-model changes, the text rendered inside the ContentControl instance is updated to reflect the new text.</p>
<h4>Building Compound User Interfaces</h4>
<p>The third part of the equation is assigning a data template to the view, which describes the visual structure of an object. A data template is a window resource.</p>
<pre>&lt;Window…&gt;
  &lt;Window.Resources&gt;
    &lt;DataTemplate DataType=”{Type system:String}”&gt;
      &lt;TextBlock Text=”{Binding StringFormat={}The application name is &amp;#x2014; {0}}”/&gt;
    &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
  &lt;/Window.Resources&gt;
  …
&lt;/Window&gt;</pre>
<p>This modifies the appearance of the ContentControl instance. Instead of rendering plain text with just the name of the application, the output is decorated with some additional text and special characters, and looks like this.</p>

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
<p>Essentially, the outcome of what appears on the screen is now split into three classes – a view-model, a view, and a data template that specifies which determines which view to use to render a view-model.</p>
<p>It’s a small step from here to building complete user interfaces using this style of programming.</p>
<p>This is done by having a custom view-model class for the window as shown above, then adding another view-model to it as a public, bindable property called SelectedView.</p>
<pre>public class ShellViewModel
{
  …
  private Object _selectedView;

  public Object SelectedView
  {
    get
    {
      return _selectedView;
    }

    set
    {
      if (value == _selectedView)
      {
        return;
      }

      _selectedView = value;
      OnPropertyChanged(nameof(SelectedView));
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>It is preferred that SelectedView be a custom type instead of System.Object. A different view-model is required for each view that the application needs to render. For example, if the application requires tabs for a calories consumed calculator and a speed calculator, then two view-models must be made for each of these tabs. Having a common base class between them ensures type-safety when switching between the two view-models.</p>
<p>A custom renderer is also required for each view. Renderers are typically built on top of the UserControl class. The declarative syntax of XAML makes it very easy to build a user interface with any kind of layout.</p>
<p>The example below shows a SpeedCalculatorView that computes the value of speed based on the time taken and distance covered.</p>
<pre>&lt;UserControl …&gt;
  &lt;Grid&gt;
    &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
      &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="150"/&gt;
      &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="250"/&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;

    &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
      &lt;RowDefinition Height="Auto"/&gt;
      &lt;RowDefinition Height="Auto"/&gt;
      &lt;RowDefinition Height="Auto"/&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock Grid.Column="0" Grid.Row="0" Text="Time"/&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock Grid.Column="0" Grid.Row="1" Text="Distance"/&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock Grid.Column="0" Grid.Row="2" Text="Speed"/&gt;

    &lt;TextBox Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="0" Text="{Binding Time}"/&gt;
    &lt;TextBox Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="1" Text="{Binding Distance}"/&gt;
    &lt;TextBox Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="2" Text="{Binding Speed}"/&gt;
  &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;</pre>
<p>The window resources contains a DataTemplate declaration to associate the SpeedCalculatorView with the SpeedCalculatorViewModel. The user interface is changed by setting the value of SelectedView in ShellViewModel to an instance of SpeedCalculatorViewModel.</p>
<p>In the next part, I will cover how to add interactivity to this application.</p>

		<p>In the previous post I described the rationale and the approach to building a custom fitness tracker for the desktop. The application was to be built using the Windows Presentation Foundation. As far as execution goes, I had a lot to learn about the correct way to use WPF. The first commit of the application followed so many WinForms paradigms that it made zero sense to involve the overhead of WPF.</p>
<p><img style="display: inline; background-image: none;" title="FitNet Desktop screenshot" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/fitnet.desktop.png" alt="FitNet Desktop screenshot" border="0" /></p>
<p>This is what the XAML that implements the above screen looked like.</p>
<pre>&lt;TabControl&gt;
     &lt;TabItem Header="Summary"&gt;
         &lt;fit:Summary/&gt;
     &lt;/TabItem&gt;
     &lt;TabItem Header="Reports"&gt;
         &lt;Label&gt;Reports View&lt;/Label&gt;
     &lt;/TabItem&gt;
     &lt;TabItem Header="Tracking"&gt;
         &lt;Label&gt;Tracking View&lt;/Label&gt;
     &lt;/TabItem&gt;
&lt;/TabControl&gt;</pre>
<p>Perfectly readable, but it would quickly devolve either into a big ball of mud with XML nodes nested several layers deep in a single file, or turn into a pile of nested classes inheriting unrelated behaviour from a few common base classes. Either case was unacceptable. But I didn&#8217;t know that yet.</p>
<p>The second mistake was borrowing a data-access implementation from a previous project which was based on a primitive architecture. The template pattern that this layer implemented was fine for a small number of data objects. But it becomes tedious to build a separate reader and writer sub-class and its associated ancillary classes for every aggregate data type (and FitNet requires quite a few of those). I needed something that was easier to extend when it came to data access.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-990 aligncenter" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/fitnet.desktop-01-solution.png" alt="FitNet Desktop Solution View" width="371" height="561" /></p>
<p>The third major flaw was having monolithic namespaces out of ignorance of the WPF architectural style, and not using its paradigms to the best benefit. This resulted in the application turning into three projects &#8211; a Desktop project as the primary executable, a Desktop.Lib library project as a massive collection of view classes, and a Persistence project which implemented the aforementioned half-functioning data access layer.</p>
<p>I went through this path for several weeks before finally realising my folly, by which time I had actually built quite a bit of useful functionality in the application. But it was getting unwieldy to make any modifications or add new functionality. It seemed like I was constantly fighting against the framework in order to get things done.</p>
<p>I had finally had enough of this struggle when I had to implement a flyout for modifying the list of exercises in the database. Adding yet another node to the already crowded main window file and more inline click event handlers in the backing CS file were a clear indicator that I was doing this wrong. There was no way this could scale up elegantly.</p>
<p>This is where I decided to take a step back and try to understand what the heck was going on.</p>
<p>Fortunately I stumbled upon XPence, an expense tracking application built on WPF by Siddhartha S. and hosted with an in-depth development tutorial on Code Project.</p>
<p>Hang on for the next part where I finally begin to turn this ship around to a more meaningful course.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The recent surge in fitness-related technology innovations bodes well for the future of many people. And though the Cheeto-munching, Red Bull-guzzling stereotype for the technologists behind this progress still sticks, the truth is that more people, including programmers, are gaining awareness of their physical health and nutrition and changing lifestyles to seek improvement.</p>
<p>Latching on to this bandwagon came a surge of fitness tracking apps. FitNotes, StrongLifts 5&#215;5, the Starting Strength App by legendary strength-training coach Mark Rippetoe, Strong App for iOS, and many more, provide ample choice to the enthusiast as well as advanced lifter. These apps cover various aspects, from simple tracking, to full blown programme design with progressions and periodisation. Some applications work online. Your data is stored on their server, and requires an internet connection to access and update. Others are offline, or a hybrid of both modes. Many are free and use ad revenue to sustain operations. Some of the fancier ones are paid. They all have their pros and cons.</p>
<p>Having used a small subset of them in the past few years, I have identified certain shortcomings between them.</p>
<h4>Incompatible Storage</h4>
<p>This is especially annoying because most of these applications use the same database engine &#8211; SQLite. But it&#8217;s impossible to move from one application to another without a lot of manual re-entry of data.</p>
<p>Now this is an understandable shortcoming. Database design is an engineering activity. People approach the same problem differently based on their skill levels and priorities. Copying databases between applications will never work directly. But the problem can be mitigated to a great extent by the industry agreeing to a common minimum format that they all support, which can be used to send data out of the application. Customers do not like being locked in.</p>
<h4>Changing Platforms</h4>
<p>Mobile phones change often. I have found myself switching between Blackberry to Android to iOS in a few short years. Fitness journeys last a lifetime. Phones last a few years, at best.</p>
<p>This is to some extent, a manifestation of point 1 above. If the common minimum format were to come together, changing platforms would become much easier. However, there&#8217;s another more subtle point. The one unchanged platform over all these years has been the desktop and the Windows operating system. People usually have access to at least one Windows computer. Even though Android has become the most popular operating system, the Windows desktop remains firmly lodged into place at workplaces, schools and homes. It&#8217;s still a very stable and dependable platform to target.</p>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>It is possible to cast all these troubles away and switch to a web-based application. However, people are not always comfortable with storing sensitive personal information on a server that is not in their control. Not to mention the risk of the company going belly-up and taking their precious PR logs along with it.</p>
<p>This is a no-brainer. Put the data on the user&#8217;s own computer, where they do not have to worry about losing their privacy. Include an automated backup feature that saves the encrypted data on their cloud-storage service. The data remains reasonably safe from loss as well as from prying eyes. Again, a common minimum format can prove to be very useful in the worst case scenario of 100% loss of the physical computer itself.</p>
<p>These were real and personal pain-points I experienced first-hand. And being a programmer gave me the ability to actually work on a solution that addresses these problems.</p>
<h3>Introducing FitNet</h3>
<p>The easiest replacement to these woes was a spreadsheet. Smack a new row for every workout, see real-time graph updates. It works as a log, but getting a report out of it is a chore. Besides, programming fancy reports into a spreadsheet eventually turns it into a prime feature for The Daily WTF. So that was out. Microsoft Access used to be a very good tool for this kind of tasks, but it still leaves out graphical reports. And the new monthly subscription model for Office 365 just isn&#8217;t for me.</p>
<h4>Enter Windows Presentation Foundation.</h4>
<p>I have been using Windows Forms since the longest time as the tool of choice for building desktop applications on Windows. It&#8217;s easy and it&#8217;s straightforward, and anybody who&#8217;s working with the previous Windows API feels perfectly at home with the new managed API that WinForms represents.</p>
<p>Windows Presentation Foundation is different. It is not just a wrapper around the Windows API. It&#8217;s a whole different framework which eschews the disparate development sub-frameworks from the Windows API in favour of a single well-integrated and extensible library. It also accounts for differing device capabilities in a more resilient fashion by abstracting away tasks like drawing objects relative to the device resolution and hardware accelerated graphics available out of the box without any extra effort. Finally, WPF brings a new type of resource &#8211; a XAML file &#8211; to be used as a declarative approach to building and programming user-interface elements rather than the procedural approach required by the Windows API.</p>
<p>This means that the following 50 lines of code…</p>
<pre>WNDCLASSEX wc;
HWND hwnd;
MSG Msg;

// Registering the Window Class
wc.cbSize        = sizeof(WNDCLASSEX);
wc.style         = 0;
wc.lpfnWndProc   = WndProc;
wc.cbClsExtra    = 0;
wc.cbWndExtra    = 0;
wc.hInstance     = hInstance;
wc.hIcon         = LoadIcon(NULL, IDI_APPLICATION);
wc.hCursor       = LoadCursor(NULL, IDC_ARROW);
wc.hbrBackground = (HBRUSH)(COLOR_WINDOW+1);
wc.lpszMenuName  = NULL;
wc.lpszClassName = g_szClassName;
wc.hIconSm       = LoadIcon(NULL, IDI_APPLICATION);

if (!RegisterClassEx(&amp;wc))
{
MessageBox(NULL, "Window Registration Failed!", "Error!",
MB_ICONEXCLAMATION | MB_OK);
return 0;
}

// Create the window
hwnd = CreateWindowEx(
WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE,
g_szClassName,
"FitNet Desktop",
WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,
CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, 400, 300,
NULL, NULL, hInstance, NULL);

if (NULL == hwnd)
{
MessageBox(NULL, "Could not create application window.", "Error", MB_ICONEXCLAMATION | MB_OK);

return 0;
}

ShowWindow(hwnd, nCmdShow);
UpdateWindow(hwnd);

// Message loop
while(GetMessage(&amp;Msg, NULL, 0, 0) &gt; 0)
{
TranslateMessage(&amp;Msg);
DispatchMessage(&amp;Msg);
}
return Msg.wParam;</pre>
<p>…can be distilled down to…</p>
<pre>&lt;Window x:Class="WpfApplication1.Window1"
xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
Title="FitNet Desktop" Height="400" Width="300" /&gt;</pre>
<p>Now it can be argued that the Windows Forms API also offers similar succinctness. But WPF takes this to a whole different level as I learned through the course of my project.</p>
<p>This series of articles is an ongoing log of my journey of building FitNet &#8211; a fitness tracker that meets my own needs.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In the first part of this series, I introduced readers to the work reify, which means to make something real. So far, we have seen how the ActionScript application converts a logging request into a command object, serialises it into a byte array, and sends it over a TCP socket connection into the waiting arms of a server. The server for its part must deserialise the byte array back into a command object and execute it.</p>
<p>This last part in the series explains how this is done.</p>
<p>The Story So Far</p>
<p>We have seen how the Puppeteer receives a message. In the receive callback method is a call to deserialise the message into an object.</p>
<pre class="">byte[] message = new byte[messageLength];
Buffer.BlockCopy(buffer, 4, message, 0, messageLength);

ICommand command = Util.Deserialize(message);</pre>
<p>The Deserialize utility method receives only the portion of the message that constitutes the actual data. The first 32 bits are discarded as they are not relevant to the deserialisation process. The Deserialize method is extremely simple.</p>
<pre class="">public static ICommand Deserialize(byte[] message)
{
    Dictionary<byte, Type> instructionClassMap = new Dictionary<byte, Type>() { { 0x02, typeof(Trace) } };

    Type commandType = null;
    ICommand command = null;
    if (instructionClassMap.TryGetValue(message[0], out commandType))
    {
        command = (ICommand)Activator.CreateInstance(commandType, new object[] { message });
    }

    return command;
}</pre>
<p>It reads the first byte from the message which contains the instruction to be executed. The instruction is then used as key to look for the type in the instruction map. The Activator.CreateInstance() API is used to instantiate the type into a variable. The instance is then returned from the function.</p>
<p style="transition: transform 1s ease 0s;">The receive callback then dispatches a CommandReceived event. The application implements the plumbing from that point onward to handle the event notification and act upon it.</p>
<p style="transition: transform 1s ease 0s;">At this point, we need to take a step back and observe the command object instantiation in detail. Each command type has its own implementation detail which interprets and utilises the message. The Trace class, for example, reads the level, category and message values from the message. Its constructor is listed below.</p>
<pre class="">public Trace(byte[] message)
{
    int unixTimeStamp = message[1] << 24 | message[2] << 16 | message[3] << 8 | message[4];
    TimeStamp = Util.UnixTimeStampToDateTime((double)unixTimeStamp);
    int paramCount = message[5] << 24 | message[6] << 16 | message[7] << 8 | message[8];
    parameters = new string[paramCount];
    int index = 9;
    
    for (int i = 0; i << paramCount; i++)
    {
        int length = message[index] << 8 | message[index + 1];
        parameters[i] = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(message, index + 2, length);

        index += (2 + length);
    }

    Level = parameters[0];
    Category = parameters[1];
    Parameters = parameters;
}</pre>
<p>The first byte contains the instruction. This is ignored since we already know that the instruction is Trace (0x02).</p>
<p>The next four bytes contain the timestamp of the message as a 32-bit integer. The value is converted into DateTime object through a utility method.</p>
<p>The next four bytes contain the number of parameters that are passed into the Trace command. The command uses this number to determine the number of string objects to retrieve from the message. Remember that each string object is prefixed by a 16-bit integer that contains the number of characters that make up the string. That's where the index + 2 comes from, which offsets the current position in the array by another 2 bytes. Once the parameters are loaded into an array, they are assigned to public accessors of the Trace class.</p>
<p>The application uses the public members to display the Trace command on screen and store them into a database for persistence.</p>

		<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="https://notadesigner.com/socket-talk-interprocess-communications-by-example/" rel="bookmark">Socket Talk – Interprocess Communications by Example</a></h1>
	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In <a href="/a-message-in-a-socket-interprocess-communications-by-example/">the previous article in this series</a>, I explained the logging framework that the Flex SDK provides, limitations of the Flash Player at providing effective run-time logging, and how they can be circumvented by using the Socket API. I also described a custom message data structure that encodes the information to be sent out of the Flash Player. This part of the article explores the implementation of the socket server that receives the message, and how it decodes it into meaningful instructions and information.</p>
<h3 style="transition: transform 1s ease 0s;">Introducing…Puppeteer!</h3>
<p>Puppeteer is a desktop application that runs on Windows which can be used to manipulate one or more client applications. The application works by opening up a TCP port for client applications to connect to, then exchanging messages over the connection to send or receive instructions back and forth. Messages are binary-encoded and follow a simple format which was described in the previous article. Instructions are 8-bit integers, and therefore, have an upper limit of 255 possible values. The message may contain an additional payload along with the instruction. There is no limit to the length of the message.</p>
<p>Client applications require to integrate the ability to dispatch, receive and parse messages to Puppeteer. It cannot connect to any application on its own without the application explicitly requesting the connection, and having the ability to dispatch or react to messages from the server. Client applications can be written on any platform that supports TCP sockets.</p>
<p>On startup, Puppeteer begins listening for incoming connections from client applications on a well-known port number. It also accommodates certain idiosyncrasies specific to the Flash Player. Applications written in other languages can ignore these aspects, as they are most likely not relevant to their own ability to function correctly.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Hello!&#8221;</h3>
<p>One of the restrictions applied on the Flash Player is that every TCP socket connection must be explicitly authorised by the owner of that server. To quote Peleus Uhley from the Adobe website &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>One of these features is the ability to create TCP sockets in order to exchange data with servers. From a network administrator&#8217;s point of view, the idea that content from the Internet could make socket connections to internal hosts is scary. This is why Flash Player requires permission from the target host before it will allow content to make the network connection.</p></blockquote>
<p>The policy file is requested automatically by the Flash Player the first time the content playing in makes the connect() API call. The process followed is described below.</p>
<ol>
<li>The content (.swf file playing the the Flash Player) requests a connection to the server through the Socket API.</li>
<li>The Flash Player checks its whitelist if the server has already allowed access to the content.</li>
<li>If it does not already have a policy file for the server in memory, it pauses the connection request from the content and instead tries to connect on port number 843. If a connection is established on this port number, it sends a message containing the string &#8220;&#8221;.</li>
<li>If the server does not respond on port number 843 unti timeout, the Flash Player attempts to connect again on the same port number that is requested by the content.</li>
<li>The server must respond by sending back the contents of the policy file as soon as the connection is accepted. Any other response from the server will be considered invalid and the Flash Player will disconnect from the server.</li>
<li>Once the policy file is served, the Flash Player parses it for correctness and checks if it authorises the content to connect to the server. If the policy file allows the connection, the content is notified about it and is now able to communicate freely with the server.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the first requirement for Puppeteer is to be able to listen for a client request for a socket policy file and serve it up. The application does not listen for incoming policy file requests on port 843. Instead, it responds with the policy file when the client attempts to connect on the public incoming request port number (1337 by default). The response is an XML document encoded as a null-terminated string. The null at the end is necessary. The XML response will be treated invalid without it (many hours were wasted in learning this seemingly insignificant detail).</p>
<h3>A Mirrored Standard for Commands</h3>
<p>Puppeteer works in tandem with the command pattern implemented by its corresponding client library. Each message is serialised into a byte array, which contains the instruction number of the command being invoked, and the payload that accompanies the instruction. It must, therefore, be able to parse and interpret the message, which is done by mirroring the ICommand interface and its implementation classes in .NET.</p>
<pre class="">public interface ICommand
{
    event ExecutionCompletedHandler ExecutionCompleted;

    DateTime TimeStamp
    {
        get;
    }

    void Execute();
}</pre>
<p>The ICommand interface declares the Execute() method, same as the one contained within the ActionScript code. It also declares a public property called TimeStamp and an ExecutionComplete event. A CommandBase class implements this interface and provides the basic common set of methods which are required to fulfill this contract.</p>
<pre class="">public abstract class CommandBase : ICommand
{
    …
}</pre>
<p>Finally, separate classes are written for each command that Puppeteer must be able to interpret and understand.</p>
<pre class="">public class Trace : CommandBase
{
    …
}</pre>
<h3>Insert Plug Here</h3>
<p>The previous article talked about sockets very briefly. So let me explain that topic before proceeding.</p>
<p>Sockets are a software construct that operating systems use to communicate over the network. They are handles to resources over a network interface, same as files are handles to resources on the hard disk. They come in various different types, of which datagram and stream sockets are most commonly heard of. They are often referred to by the protocol they typically use &#8211; UDP for datagram sockets, and TCP for stream sockets. Puppeteer is built on stream sockets. The .NET framework ships with a managed implementation of the socket API in the System.Net.Sockets namespace. The Socket class is the primary actor in this namespace.</p>
<p>On startup, the application begins with instantiating the Socket class, binding it to a local end point and setting it to listen for incoming connection requests.</p>
<pre class="">listener = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);
endPoint = new IPEndPoint(0x0100007F, 1337);
listener.Bind(endPoint);
listener.Listen(0);
listener.BeginAccept(BUFFER_SIZE, new AsyncCallback(AcceptConnection), listener);</pre>
<p>In this example, a stream socket is initialised to use the IPv4 addressing scheme and TCP protocol. In order to begin listening, the socket must be bound to an end point, which is a combination of an IP address and a port number. Every TCP connection can be uniquely identified by its two end points &#8211; one on the host, and the other on the client. The IPEndPoint class represents an end point on one end of the connection. The IP address of the end point is represented as a hexadecimal-encoded, big-endian 64-bit integer.</p>
<p>Note: The IP address of the computer is hard-coded to 127.0.0.1 in this example. There are more sophisticated techniques to identify the IP address of the computer that the application runs on at run-time which are excluded here for brevity.</p>
<p>Listen is a non-blocking API call. The thread continues to run while the socket is listening for incoming connections. For single-threaded applications, the programmer must put the application into a loop while calling BeginAccept() periodically, in order to prevent it from exiting. Since Puppeteer is a Windows Forms application, this is not necessary.</p>
<p>The buffer size parameter of the BeginAccept API specifies the number of bytes that the server has to read from the message sent by the client. The AsyncCallback is a reference to a callback that is fired when an incoming connection request is received. The last parameter is a state object which can be used to pass around the state of the connection. In this case, the Socket instance itself is used as the state object.</p>
<p>The callback contains code to handover the connection from the listener to another Socket instance dedicated to communicating with the client. This is required so that the listener can be freed to continue to listen for incoming requests on from other clients. The EndAccept() API automatically creates a new Socket instance to communicate with the client.</p>
<pre class="">private void AcceptConnection(IAsyncResult result)
{
    Socket listener = (Socket)result.AsyncState;
    Socket clientSocket = listener.EndAccept(result);

    byte[] response = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(SocketPolicy);
    clientSocket.BeginSend(response, 0, response.Length, SocketFlags.None, new AsyncCallback(SendData), clientSocket);
    listener.BeginAccept(new AsyncCallback(AcceptConnection), listener);
}</pre>
<p>Once the connection has been established on the new socket, the server must first publish the string containing the socket policy file required by the Flash Player. It does this with the BeginSend method on the new socket. Finally, the original socket instance which is bound to a well-known port number is set back to accept incoming connection requests.</p>
<p>The .NET framework triggers an AsyncCallback when the data has been sent over the new socket instance. This callback signals the socket to end the sending operation, clears the incoming buffer and sets the socket to begin receiving data when the client sends it.</p>
<pre class="">private void SendData(IAsyncResult result)
{
    Socket clientSocket = (Socket)result.AsyncState;
    clientSocket.EndSend(result);
    Array.Clear(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
    clientSocket.BeginReceive(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE, SocketFlags.None, new AsyncCallback(ReceiveData), clientSocket);
}</pre>
<p>The last stage in this cycle is to receive and process the data, and either respond to the data if required, or set the client socket back into the receiving state as shown here. This is where the meat of the operation occurs. The basic structure of the ReceiveData() method is shown below.</p>
<pre class="">private void ReceiveData(IAsyncResult result)
{
    Socket clientSocket = (Socket)result.AsyncState;

    if (clientSocket.Connected)
    {
        Array.Clear(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        clientSocket.BeginReceive(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE, SocketFlags.None, new AsyncCallback(ReceiveData), clientSocket);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Some basic processing is also performed in this method. The application is aware of the message structure that was described in the previous article in this series. The ReceiveData method receives the entire message, but only processes the first four bytes which contain the total length of the message. The rest of the bytes from the message are read from the buffer into a byte array and passed on to a deserialisation utility class, which converts it into an ICommand instance.</p>
<pre class="">private void ReceiveData(IAsyncResult result)
{
    Socket clientSocket = (Socket)result.AsyncState;

    // Extract the length of the message from the first 4 bytes
    int messageLength = buffer[0] << 24 | buffer[1] << 16 | buffer[2] << 8 | buffer[3];

    // Extract the bytes containing the message and deserialize it into an ICommand object
    byte[] message = new byte[messageLength];
    Buffer.BlockCopy(buffer, 4, message, 0, messageLength);

    ICommand command = Util.Deserialize(message);

    if (clientSocket.Connected)
    {
        Array.Clear(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        clientSocket.BeginReceive(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE, SocketFlags.None, new AsyncCallback(ReceiveData), clientSocket);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Finally, the method triggers a CommandReceived event which other classes in the application subscribe to in order to act upon the command.</p>
<pre class="">private void ReceiveData(IAsyncResult result)
{
    Socket clientSocket = (Socket)result.AsyncState;

    // Extract the length of the message from the first 4 bytes
    int messageLength = buffer[0] << 24 | buffer[1] << 16 | buffer[2] << 8 | buffer[3];

    // Extract the bytes containing the message and deserialize it into an ICommand object
    byte[] message = new byte[messageLength];
    Buffer.BlockCopy(buffer, 4, message, 0, messageLength);

    ICommand command = Util.Deserialize(message);

    if (null == CommandReceived)
    {
        return;
    }

    CommandReceivedEventArgs e = new CommandReceivedEventArgs(command);
    CommandReceived(this, e);

    if (clientSocket.Connected)
    {
        Array.Clear(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        clientSocket.BeginReceive(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE, SocketFlags.None, new AsyncCallback(ReceiveData), clientSocket);
    }
}</pre>
<p>In the next part in this series, I will explain how the command is deserialised and executed by the Puppeteer.</p>
