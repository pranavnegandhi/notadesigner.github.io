	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It is really amazing how fast the week has gone by. Between the daily grind and a weekend back home in Mumbai, I have not had the time to ride on my new bicycle at all. All I do is use it for my regular commute, albeit with a lot more style.</p>
<p>During the past year I had cycled enough to know exactly what kind of cycling interested me the most – a comfortable commute and some medium distance touring. After tons of research on different bicycle websites and forums, I had more or less decided on the following specifications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional geometry frame</li>
<li>Multiple gears</li>
<li>Drop bars</li>
<li>Large wheelbase</li>
<li>Narrow tires</li>
<li>Light weight</li>
<li>Mudguards and rear rack (those could be added as accessories to<br />
any bike)</li>
<li>Ability to handle the occasional untarred road</li>
</ul>
<p>Most dealers kept pushing mountain bikes or road bikes upon me. That is until I came upon the Navigator in one of the stores at Nana Peth. It seemed like a well-designed bike, although I was not sure yet if this would be the perfect one for me. For one, it was built around a compact geometry, with a sloping top tube. But given<br />
that I would be riding it mostly on my daily commute rather than touring around the country, I was willing to compromise on that point. The second drawback of the Navigator was that it had riser bars rather than the drop bars I was more interested in having.</p>
<p>After dilly-dallying for almost two months, I finally compromised and picked up the Navigator because it met most other requirements, while fitting in nicely within my budget.</p>
<h3>Looks That Kill</h3>
<p>The LA Sovereign Navigator looks good. Its silver body with black graphics makes it a sure-shot eye-catcher. I have had motorcyclists and rickshaw drivers slow down alongside with approving nods, pedestrians turn heads as I race past and<br />
colleagues congregate around it during lunch to discuss its features. In fact, it looks so pretty that it is sure to be a thief magnet. That is not to say that I have experimented with this quality of the bike. But I need to stop tempting fate and get a good U-lock for it soon. The complimentary cable lock is too short and too flimsy to hold off a determined crook.</p>
<h3>Up to Task</h3>
<p>The daily commute is not a race and the potholed roads are far from a racetrack. Although I did not realize this at first, the ideal bicycle for such conditions would let me ride with an almost upright posture, while propelling me fast enough with little<br />
effort. The Navigator meets all these requirements and more.</p>
<p>The riser bar is easy to reach, but because it only gives one grip position, I am not sure how well my hands will do on a long ride. The seat was too low during my first ride and did not allow my leg to be completely extended. Not to mention that I looked like a dork. I have now lifted the seat post up to its minimum insertion mark and it seems much better.</p>
<p>The frame is very light and easily goes several hundred metres with a single turn of the pedal once it picks up speed. In fact, it is so light that the first time I rode it, I was afraid that putting too much load in one spot would break something. I am also able to lift it up two floors to our apartment every evening without any trouble.</p>
<p>The tyres are narrow, with a patterned tread that provides good traction on all kinds of asphalt and tar surfaces. The V-brakes provide sufficient stopping power to halt those wheels in their tracks, although I have not had any need to test their full<br />
potential as yet.</p>
<p>The Shimano Tourney gears are sufficient for my purpose, although I am yet to make them go through their test of mettle. There are some adjustment problems with the gears, but because of my limited exposure to them I have deferred fiddling with them for the store mechanics instead.</p>
<h3>Finishing Touches</h3>
<p>It also comes with front and rear mudguards that run close to the wheel and cover a large arc – the best types. I have ridden in some light to medium rain and have not had any problem with the slush hitting my back. There are some dents on the front mudguard which I brought to the notice of the dealer and the customer service folks at LA Sovereign. Both have promised a replacement shortly. I might remove the mudguards after the monsoons are over to give the cycle a sleeker look as well as make it lighter.</p>
<p>The rear rack is useless as it does not have a spring clamp to hold things. I will need to carry some nylon ropes or a bungee cord, which becomes a hassle to tie and untie. The backpack is a more practical option for my short, daily ride. But I will need to consider an alternative when I go for a longer spin. Again, since I do not use it much, I have an option of removing it completely.</p>
<p>A quainter feature is the bell, not seen on most high-end bikes these days, making them dangerous while travelling amongst jaywalking pedestrians. The cycle itself barely makes a whisper. It certainly is nice to have something to draw the attention of people who inadvertently step into my path rather than slamming the brakes every few metres.</p>
<p>The most eye-catching feature of the Navigator is the dynamo-driven headlight. It is a low-powered affair, enough only to make me visible at night or in the rain. But given the frequent load shedding in Pune, any illumination is most welcome.</p>
<h3>And Finally</h3>
<p>LA Sovereign seems to have a policy to sell an experience rather than bicycles. Their customer service department has been consistently responsive, polite and honest. Even before I had finalized on which brand I would go for, their customer service team gave me honest replies about their product range, highlighting features and drawbacks of the bicycles I had short-listed.</p>
<p>Surendar Cycles, the dealer from Pune from whom I made the purchase, follows a similar philosophy. I had already done my homework so he did not have to go through a sales pitch with me. But he was the only dealer I visited who dissuaded me from converting the riser bars into drop bars, which I was rather keen<br />
upon earlier.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ami was attending a retreat with some of her work colleagues at Lonavala last Friday and Saturday. Although I was not sure what I would be doing while she was gone, I was certain that it would involve cycling.</p>
<p>Some of my colleagues had gone out to lunch on Wednesday and amongst them was good friend and fellow biker Amit (not to be confused with good wife and fellow biker Ami). He owns a Trek 4300D and regularly rides long distances on it. In the course of our conversation, one of us brought up the suggestion of a ride this weekend. Since Ami was going to be at Lonavala, we too decided to be there and surprise her.</p>
<p>Friday night I got home from visiting Surendra Cycles at Karve Road (that is another story, on another thread) and hit the sack early. We were to meet at 5:30 near my home and take the National Highway . Amit was waiting for me at 5:45 and I went down. This is where the fun began.</p>
<p>When I went down the cycle was not standing upright, as I had left it, but completely keeled over to one side, leaning against the wall. The cycle had developed a slow puncture in the rear tire from my trip the last evening. Fisssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss&#8230;</p>
<p>I was completely helpless at that point and called up Amit. He came over and we waited out at my place until the cycle store opened. Incidentally, it had occurred to me several times in the past few days to ask Amit to carry his puncture kit, but I ignored it. This was going to cramp our schedule big-time &#8211; over two hours lost.</p>
<h3>Time to go</h3>
<p>Finally, at 8-ish we pushed our cycles to the store. It took a few minutes for the patch-up to be completed and the ride was ready to roll again (Note to self: buy puncture kit). The sun was high in the sky by now. As mentioned in a previous post, the Pimpri-Chinchwad portion of the National Highway is a pleasure to ride. However, that applies only when you sweep off all other traffic and stray cattle from the road. I had three near misses with an autorickshaw, a pedestrian and a Mahindra Jeep when they broke the signal (except for the pedestrian, who was taking a leisurely stroll in the middle of the road). Once past Jai Hind Industries, up to where I had ridden the last time around, I was into virgin territory for my bicycle. From here onwards, commuter traffic began to thin out in favour of trucks.</p>
<p>On entering Dehu Road , we were into heaven, sort of &#8211; lush greenery all around, with an intermittent squatter generating&#8230;ahem&#8230;fertilizer for the plants. I had seen such views by the railway tracks in Mumbai. However, watching them answer nature&#8217;s call on a 100-foot tall hill amongst fresh grass and goats even astonished me.</p>
<h3>Halt!</h3>
<p>We had been doing good time so far &#8211; 22 kilometres an hour and we had reached so far in just under an hour and a half. I called for the first break at Dehu Road . We stopped and I got off for a few minutes to ease the cramping in my thighs. I was now beginning to push myself beyond any previous ride attempt and would soon begin to show.</p>
<p>At little while later, near Vadgaon, I realized that the Maggi that I had had for breakfast had moved over and left a gaping void in my stomach. So we stopped again and had some biscuits and plenty of water. Since we were still hungry, we rolled into the first roadside hotel that showed up and feasted on wada&#8217;s and a masala dosa. After refilling our bottles with water, we were on our way again.</p>
<p>Now is where the fun begins. All of a sudden, we were caught in a sweeping sheet of rain. However, before we had removed the rain gear from the bags and put it on, it had stopped. We left the jacket on anyways and continued onwards.</p>
<h3>Uphill</h3>
<p>I had to get off the bike at Kamshet because the slope was too steep for me to pedal the Exodus upon (what was this designer thinking when he fed it over 25 kilos of aluminium and steel?). On the other hand, Amit merrily clipped along up the hill in low gear.</p>
<p>Going downhill was much easier upon my legs and I coasted along easily until the next uphill slope before Karla. Once past this slope, the road flattened out into the distance for many kilometres. We could read the milestones counting down the distance to Lonavala &#8211; chhey, paanch, chaar, chhey&#8230;what?! Oh well, never mind. Somebody had mixed up the old and new milestones and could not be bothered to come and fix them again. After all, what&#8217;s a couple of kilometres here or there for a car. Try to explain that to a cyclist though.</p>
<h3>The Final Stretch</h3>
<p>After that, we were unmindful of the milestones. We would know we were there once we actually got there. On that note, we forged ahead full steam and shortly found ourselves mired in the traffic jams of Lonavala. It is amazing how a perfectly serene spot is vandalized by our society in the name of development. What was once an idyllic retreat for retirees has now turned into a weekend picnic spot featuring a water park, plenty of restaurants to stuff your face and unorganized traffic. It is like the Mumbaikars (yes, I am looking at you) have brought a slice of Mumbai to Lonavala and instead of gobbling it up or taking it back, have left rotting leftovers for the Lonavalaites.</p>
<p>After this point, the road was downhill, with brief humps that the momentum of our bikes would take us over. We were going so fast that I barely noticed the sign to the resort that Ami was in and screeched to a halt just in time. We entered into the lane, and after some searching, finally found the road that led to the resort.</p>
<p>The road was a sheer slope, well beyond 45 degrees, covered with slippery and evilly sharp edged rocks. Amit easily went down on the Trek, but I was completely out of my element with my road-riding configuration. I was probably violating every rule of mountain biking &#8211; no helmet, a tall seat reaching above the handlebar, slippery calliper brakes and smoother tyre treads.</p>
<p>I did the prudent thing and dismounted, then lugged the cycle down the slope.</p>
<p>I left a note at the hotel reception and sent it to Ami. The smile on her face when she came down made the entire gruelling journey worthwhile.</p>
<p>We left after lunch at the hotel, but it was already quite late. Neither one of us was in the mood to ride 70 kilometres back home, especially since we would still be on the highway by the time it was dark without any lights. So instead, we purchased luggage tickets for the bicycles and boarded the Pune local. We left Lonavala at 5:20 and were back home by 6:45.</p>
<h3>Some tips for bringing your cycle by train</h3>
<p>The ticket clerk did not have a clue about bringing bicycles by train. He told me that it was not possible. Not looking forward to riding back in the dark, I persisted and spoke to the chief ticket inspector on the station. He told me that he would be able to make a luggage ticket for me.</p>
<p>The handy-dandy-freight-fare-reference book that the Indian Railways provides to its employees was probably written when the first train chugged from Boribunder to Thane, and has never been updated since. In the absence of a weighing scale, bicycles are to be considered as weighing 40 kilograms, which is quite absurd. We would have to be descendants of Hercules to be able to push 40 kilograms of anything over 70 kilometres. We tried to reason for a bit, but it turned out to be fruitless.</p>
<p>We went onto the platform and waited for the local train to arrive. We loaded the bicycles while the compartment was still empty and found comfortable seats. Amit&#8217;s Trek was a great conversation starter with the locals.</p>
<p>I was glad when we stopped at Khadki station an hour later. One side of the platform at Khadki is reserved for military trains and hence was empty. Amit took the opportunity to live his childhood dream &#8211; riding a bicycle on a railway platform &#8211; a final bit of delight to a very enjoyable trip.</p>
<h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
<p>A non-geared bike is no match for a geared bike.</p>
<p>You can go anywhere on any reasonable bike. The condition of a bike matters less than the conditioning of the rider.</p>
<p>Going uphill on a non-geared bike builds character.</p>
<p>Going downhill on a steep slope can easily turn into a white-knuckle ride.</p>
<p>Riding a cycle lets you take in the entire road and not just visit a destination.</p>
<p>Safety is entirely your responsibility. I did not expect a single motorist to go warily around me and did my own defensive riding. Since I am not writing from a hospital bed, I can assume that this works.</p>

		<h3>Using SVN</h3>
<p>Subversion, or svn, is a very popular version control tool, used by some of the best software teams in the world. The fact that it is free and open source, in addition to being really, really good may have something to do with that. Like most good version control tools, Subversion too is split into two components – a server and a client.</p>
<p>You don’t need to worry about the server usually because it is set up on a system far out of your reach. If you are located in North America or Europe, it means that your company has outsourced the Subversion hosting somewhere in South America or India. Funnily enough, good companies in Bangalore (or Pune) usually outsource their Subversion hosting to a really, really good outfit in LA (read, Dreamhost). Silly. But that’s how the global economy works, and which is why it is more fun to be a software developer than to be an economist.</p>
<p>Coming back to our topic&#8230;</p>
<p>What you will use on a day-to-day basis is the Subversion command-line client (or TortoiseSVN, a GUI replacement).</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This article touches briefly upon how to get started with the client, without worrying about details. If you are a svn alpha-geek who dreams about hosting your own repository someday or whatever else you svn alpha-geeks dream about, and find my guide to be incomplete, don’t email me to write about the 10,542 variations in syntax that the svn client allows. I know you adore your svn client. But this article is targeted at people who don’t as much as <em>know</em> about svn, much less adore it.</p>
<p>Once the client is installed, you can launch a command prompt session by typing cmd into the Run dialog box in Windows and hitting enter. Once on the command prompt, type the following and hit enter.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\svn help</pre>
<p>Detailed help is also available for some of the more oft-used commands by modifying the help command like so –</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\svn help import</pre>
<h3>Import</h3>
<p>You can use the import command to <strong>add files from your computer into the repository for the first time</strong>, and hence, begin versioning them.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\svn import trunk/ file:///F:/projects/notadesigner/trunk/web/index.htm -m “Initial import”</pre>
<h3>Checkout</h3>
<p>If you are a new developer on a team that has been using Subversion for a while, you can use the checkout command <strong>to retrieve the source code from the repository onto your hard drive</strong>.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\cd projects\notadesigner\trunk
C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn checkout https://notadesigner.com/svn/trunk</pre>
<p>Note how the active directory is first changed to the path where the files have to be stored, and then the checkout command is called.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also specify the path to the working folder as a parameter to the checkout command.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\svn checkout https://notadesigner.com/svn/trunk C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk</pre>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>This is probably the next most used command in the Subversion client. Millions of developers across the globe run this command every morning to retrieve the latest version of files from the repository into their working folder. Running this command makes sure that you are running abreast of everyone else on your team, by bringing the latest changes they have committed to the repository onto your machine (and likewise, your latest changes get updated on their machines).</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn update</pre>
<p>Like true Zen, it is a deceptively simple command. Just two words that do you a whole lot of good.</p>
<h3>Add / Delete</h3>
<p>These commands do just what they say. They make changes to your working copy, and schedule the same change to the repository when you commit your changes later.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn add locations.htm
C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn delete directions.htm
C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn commit –m “Added new locations. Deleted directions because we’re spread all over the city and I didn’t know where to send them.”</pre>
<h3>Copy / Move</h3>
<p>Copy and move work exactly as they do on your operating system, except that they are targeted at the repository.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn copy jobs.htm https://notadesigner.com/svn/trunk -m “Adding new jobs page”</pre>
<p>Move requires a separate commit to implement your changes into the repository.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn move jobs.htm jobs/index.htm
C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn commit –m “Moved jobs page into separate folder”</pre>
<h3>Revert</h3>
<p>This command rolls back any changes made to a file in your working folder, and restores it to the version on the repository.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn revert contact.htm</pre>
<h3>Using TortoiseSVN</h3>
<p>TortoiseSVN lets you perform all actions that the svn command-line client lets you, without messing with the command-line. If you are new to Subversion, it’s a compelling replacement to the regular svn client.</p>
<h3>Finally, DON’T Do This</h3>
<p>I have found a shockingly large number of people doing silly things while using a VCS. I am tired of telling them not to do it and so if you abuse a VCS in any of the following ways and I catch you at it, I’ll make you write this list on a blackboard that screeches, for at least a week&#8230;without ear muffs.</p>
<p>It’s not that difficult to avoid them. So listen up.</p>
<h4>DON’T make a copy of your working folder to make edits</h4>
<p>If you are checking out files from the repository in a working folder and then making a copy of that folder to make edits because you don’t want to overwrite your old files, you’re plain crazy and haven’t understood the most basic premise of version control.</p>
<p>The repository already has a copy of your files which compile correctly. If you make a mistake, revert your files and you’re back where you began from.</p>
<h4>DON’T make a copy of your folder in the repository before editing your files</h4>
<p>A more severe case of the previous symptom is when a developer copies the entire trunk in the repository into trunk-2 (effectively creating a branch) and making edits to that.</p>
<p>If you are still unable to understand how the trunk is managed, branching is definitely out of bounds for you. Get back in line.</p>
<h4>DON’T delete old files from the repository before adding the edited working copy</h4>
<p>The whole point of version control is to have a history of your file over time. If you delete the file from your repository, you destroy that history. If you do it every time, somebody who looks at your file six months down the line will have no idea about the pedigree of your file, the bugs that have been fixed or the new code that has been added to it.</p>
<h4>DON’T forget to add comments when committing changes</h4>
<p>You’ve got to be really lazy to not add comments at the time of committing your changes. Vague comments such as “updated file” are just as useless.</p>
<p>It helps to be descriptive in the changelog because that’s the first place people go to find out what’s been cooking in your files. If you don’t tell them up front what you’ve been up to, they’ll just think that you’ve been messing up and saddle you with all the blame.</p>
<h4>DON’T forget to add new files to the repository</h4>
<p>This is a common mistake and can happen by even the most seasoned developers. But I’m writing it here to simply reinforce it that this should be avoided.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In our rush to Web 2.0 our lives, we seem to have forgotten to imbibe the essentials. Everyone is guilty of that – from fruit farmers using artificial fertilizer, to politicians driving nations to war, to developers not using version control.</p>
<p>Shocking, really.</p>
<p>I do not have much pull with the fruit farmers or international diplomats. But as a fellow developer, it’s my duty to bring back the lost software teams of today into the fold. Forget ‘enterprisey architectures’ for a while and look at the basics. In this article I will introduce you to the wholesome goodness of Subversion, a fantastic version control tool.</p>
<h3>Essentially Missing</h3>
<p>Version control is an essential tool in any software team’s kit. In spite of that, I regularly run into senior developers with years of experience who have never used it. Which is, to be honest, quite frustrating because then their working directory tends to look like this –</p>
<p>Product-latest</p>
<p>Prodcut-new-12-march (yes, it is misspelled)</p>
<p>Product-new-mar-15</p>
<p>&#8230;<a title="The Best-est Version Control" href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The_Best-est_Version_Control.aspx">and the disaster repeats till eternity</a>.</p>
<p>If you notice, this directory structure is already functions as a basic version control repository, in that it separates successive updates to the product, but without all the extra goodies that a true version control tool would let you have such as comments, labels and developer history.</p>
<h3>Towards the Light</h3>
<p>Whenever I have had the good fortune of introducing developers to version control – even with rogue tools like Visual SourceSafe – they knew this was the elixir they were missing for so long. It takes some work to actually drive it into their system. But once there, it stays on forever.</p>
<p>The single biggest advantage all of them cite is how easy it becomes to <strong>synchronize files between team members</strong>. Because everybody is updating their files every morning from the same location, it becomes easier to keep abreast with everyone’s changes.</p>
<p>The next biggest advantage is <strong>the ability to roll back mistakes</strong>. If a file has not been checked in, simply revert it back and the VCS replaces it with the latest one in the repository. Even after the file has been checked in, a previous version of the file can be retrieved from the repository and used to restore the changes made.</p>
<p>A side-effect of this feature is the ability to <strong>sandbox major changes</strong>. Rewriting core algorithms of your accounting product using that new design patterns book? (Hah!) Do it in a local working copy, test it and then <s>throw it away when you discover you suck at patterns</s> check it in after it works fine.</p>
<p>As a project’s requirements evolve, files mutate into completely different beasts from their initial incarnation. By logging a note about each change made to the file in the VCS, developers are able to <strong>track the project history</strong> in the long term.</p>
<p>Another nice feature of the tracking tools is that they help <strong>assign ownership</strong> by logging the person who has made a change. This proves to be quite helpful when giving credit, or more frequently, blamestorming.</p>
<p>And the greatest relief that a VCS provides to all stakeholders is the <strong>daily backup that occurs</strong> <strong>automatically </strong>when developers check-out the latest changes every morning. It’s rare for a team using VCS to lose a lot of data due to hard drive failures.</p>
<h3>The VCS Dictionary</h3>
<p>Let’s begin with learning the terminology used when dealing with version control.</p>
<h4>Parts of a VCS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Repository: The database storing the files. The repository is usually expected to be on a central location such as a network server, although it can exist on locally stored directories.</li>
<li>Server: The computer storing the repository. If the repository is stored on a directory on your own computer, then your computer is called the server although there is no network access involved.</li>
<li>Client: The computer connecting to the repository. Your computer.</li>
<li>Working Set/Working Copy: Your local directory of files, where you make changes.</li>
<li>Trunk/Main: The primary location for code in the repository. This is the in-progress version of code, with untested or partially implemented features. Feature-complete snapshots are stored in a branch folder.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Common Terms</h4>
<ul>
<li>Revision: What version a file is on (v1, v2, v3, etc.).</li>
<li>Head: The latest revision in the repository.</li>
<li>Commit Message: A short message entered at the time of committing a file, describing what was changed.</li>
<li>Changelog/History: A list of changes made to a file since it was created.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Basic Actions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add: Put a file into the repository for the first time.</li>
<li>Check-out: Download a file from the repository.</li>
<li>Commit/Check-in: Upload a file to the repository. The file gets a new revision number, and people can “check out” the latest one.</li>
<li>Update/Sync: Synchronize your files with the latest from the repository. This lets you grab the latest revisions of all files. Do this at least once a day.</li>
<li>Revert: Throw away your local changes and return to the latest version from the repository.</li>
<li>Diff/Change/Delta: Finding the differences between two files. Useful for seeing what changed between revisions. This only works on text files (e.g. .as, .htm, .cs). Binary files (e.g. .psd, .fla, .doc) cannot be diffed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Advanced Actions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Branch: Create a separate copy of a file/folder for private use (bug fixing, testing, etc). Branch is both a verb (”branch the code”) and a noun (”Which branch is it in?”).</li>
<li>Merge: Apply the changes from one file to another, to bring it up-to-date. For example, you can merge features from one branch into another.</li>
<li>Conflict: Occurs when two people edit the same file simultaneously. The first person to edit the file does not face any error. However, the file on the server is now out of sync with the file on the second person’s working folder. When he attempts to commit the file to the repository he gets a conflict.
<p>Conflicts can be resolved for text files by manually selecting which lines of code to keep and which ones to discard.</p>
<p>There is no way to resolve binary files. If there is a conflict in binary files, then the second person has to begin again by retrieving the latest file, and re-creating the changes made to it before the conflict occurred.</p>
<p>To avoid conflicts on binary files, a user can lock the file before editing.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Resolve: Fixing the changes that contradict each other and checking in the correct version.</li>
<li>Locking: Flagging a file for exclusive use until it is committed again.</li>
<li>Breaking the lock: Forcibly unlocking a file so you can edit it. It may be needed if someone locks a file and goes on vacation (or “calls in sick” the day Halo 3 comes out).</li>
</ul>
<h3>An Illustrated Example</h3>
<p>Pop Candy is a Java developer who has just joined the team at Timeless Software. Her task is to <a title="Zawinski's Law" href="http://www.iwar.org.uk/hackers/resources/faq/jargon.htm#Zawinski's%20Law">add an email client to their product</a>. She <strong>creates a folder on her hard drive</strong> for the project, and proceeds to <strong>check out the files from the repository</strong>.</p>
<p>Once she has the entire product code check out onto her hard drive, she compiles it and familiarizes herself with its features.</p>
<p>Once she’s ready, and <a title="Painless Functional Specifications - Why Bother?" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html">has read the spec</a>, she begins editing the first file. She adds a few more files to the project, compiles and tests. Makes a few changes, goes back and compiles and tests, and in no time at all, she has reached her first milestone. Her email client connects to the server and successfully <a title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Sample" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol#Sample_communications">handles the server’s response to HELO</a>.</p>
<p>She feels she’s achieved quite a bit for the day and proceeds to add her changes to the repository. The first step is to <strong>select the new files</strong> she’s created and <strong>adding them to the repository</strong>. Then, she selects the new files, and the ones she’s modified and <strong>commits them </strong>all in a single operation. She remembers to <strong>enter a log comment</strong> that describes the change clearly. When the other developers come in the next day and <strong>update their working copies</strong>, they’ll see that Candy has begun working on the email client.</p>
<p>The next day Candy is working on adding a rich text editor into the email client. She uses an off-the-shelf JavaScript library to do the job to save time. Smart!</p>
<p>But when her team lead reviews it, he points out to her that the terms of license of this library conflict with those of their commercial product. Candy is grumpy because it took an entire day to integrate the editor. It was her fault, though. The spec clearly stated that no off-the-shelf library is to be used. So she has to go back and undo her changes. She <strong>deletes all the unversioned files</strong> in the project folder and proceeds to <strong>revert the edited files</strong> to their head version.</p>
<p>A few days into development, as the email client begins adding bulk, the testers complain that the product itself seems to be very sluggish. Everybody scrambles to get their hands on <strong>the changelog</strong> on the date since when the testers noticed the slowdown.</p>
<p>All fingers are pointed at Candy’s code for the moment, but the team lead defers any decision until he’s actually reviewed her commits on that particular day. He retrieves the files of the previous revision and runs them through the tests. On a whim, he decides to replace their in-house SMTP test server with the live email server.</p>
<p>Luckily, it turns out that it was their testing SMTP server which was misbehaving. Instead of closing the connections on receiving QUIT, it continued to hold them. And the testers were the only ones to notice this because they sent the client through a gruelling 1,000,000 rounds of sending and receiving email.</p>
<p>You now see how easy it is to manipulate readers into seeing from your viewpoint with a contrived example veiling your actual agenda.</p>
<p>Oops!</p>
<p>No, that’s not what I meant. The moral of this story is that it is always a good idea to use version control. Version control is mother’s love and apple pie. It is the cat’s whiskers and the bee’s knees. And you just gotta have it!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have recently moved to a smaller city that can’t quite boast of the public transport system that Mumbai provides to its citizens. It does exist on paper, and when you go out you do have the option of trying to locate a public utility bus or train. But that task is so difficult that most people cave in to the temptation of flagging an auto rickshaw. Even if it costs up to ten times the price of a bus.</p>
<p>Which brings us to another problem that the people of Mumbai never have to face &#8211; auto rickshaw drivers often quote a fixed price to take you to your destination. That figure doesn’t always correspond to what the meter might have indicated had it been used. So you can either yield to their demands while feeling frustrated at being robbed in broad daylight, or haggle with them to bring them down to what you might consider a fair price. And if you don’t like haggling too much, the experience isn’t going to be very pleasant.</p>
<p>I spent the afternoon haggling with some rather brilliant code, trying to coax it to work as it was advertised it would. I’m documenting the efforts I went through out here so that I can reduce some of the agony the next time I have to do this.</p>
<h3>A Brief Background</h3>
<p>Developers and software managers everywhere laud the power and elegance of the Apache, MySQL and PHP stack. Several commercial outfits have built their entire business model around them. I have been going through the ritual of installing these three on Windows for a long time now and yet, I stumble every time I try to integrate them.</p>
<p>Installing Apache is a cinch. The developers have packaged it into a very nice installer that sets it up on your system within minutes. The default settings are fine enough for almost anybody who does not want to play system administrator. And you don’t even need to restart your system in most cases.</p>
<p>Integrating PHP on top of Apache used to be a bit of a task, but lately it’s been becoming easier. I had to add 3 lines to the Apache httpd.conf file to get it to work. There is a huge dependency on the PHP initialization file, php.ini, but the risk is reduced because the default settings in that file too are sufficient for a typical developer machine.</p>
<p>MySQL too comes with its own installer that takes away most of the pain from the setup process.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>But this is where the ease of use disappears. Making MySQL work with the Apache and PHP stack always seems to be a pain. Since I don’t do this very often, I can’t remember the integration recipe very well. I’m usually not even sure if I faced the same problems the last time around &#8211; much less the resolution.</p>
<p>This article is a guideline for me to follow the next time I have to go through installing these applications. The problem I faced and its resolution is still fresh in my mind since I only stepped through it this afternoon.</p>
<p>It all started when I attempted to load the php_mysqli.dll extension to integrate MySQL into the stack. For extensions to load, PHP needs to be given the path to the folder where the .dll files are stored. The default location is the “ext” folder under the PHP root folder. This path is defined in the variable “extensions_dir” in php.ini.</p>
<p>For some reason the path was not interpreted correctly by PHP on start-up. The Apache error log kept showing the following error &#8211;</p>
<p style="background: #ffff99; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #000;">PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library &#8216;E:\\apps\\php-5.2.3\\ext\\php_mysqli.dll&#8217; &#8211; The specified module could not be found.\r\n in Unknown on line 0</p>
<p>The double backslashes in the path baffled me because the value in php.ini was definitely not typed that way. It is a common convention to escape certain characters by placing the backslash before it, so I felt that this was mangling the path.</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>I searched the web and found that many people have faced this issue. The solutions proposed were varied.</p>
<p>Some suggested that the library file libmysql.dll bundled with PHP 5.2.3 was buggy. I replaced it with the recommended earlier version (from PHP 5.2.1) but the error still persisted. Others suggested that the extensions that were needed could be moved to the System32 folder, so that they would be found by the PATH system variable. But I refused to corrupt my OS folders with such unnecessary files.</p>
<p>The obvious other solution was to add the extensions folder to my system path, which I duly did. But to my surprise the extension still didn’t load. I checked and rechecked that the folder was included in the system path.</p>
<p>By chance I happened to run a script in my browser that called the phpinfo() function. Browsing through the values, I came upon the Apache Environment section that described how Apache interacted within the OS. And that’s where I found the problem. For some reason, even after a restarting the service, Apache continued to maintain the old system variables in its memory. Because of this, PHP didn’t know where to search for extensions and kept returning the same error.</p>
<p>Restarting Windows solved the problem.</p>
<p>I still haven’t figured out why the “extensions_dir” variable doesn’t work as expected. I have tried various combinations of front- and backslashes, besides experimenting with several relative and absolute path names without any luck. Backslashes are always escaped in the error log, although front slashes are left as-is.</p>
<p>In all, I learnt that restarting your machine does often solve problems &#8211; not through magic but through simply realigning different portions of memory that may be connected in some obscure manner. Not bad for an afternoon.</p>
<h3>WAMP Installation Checklist</h3>
<p>For the benefit of those struggling with the kind of problems I faced, here’s the complete checklist to follow when installing the AMP stack on Windows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Apache</li>
<li>Download the PHP archive and unzip into a folder of your choice</li>
<li>Add the following line to httpd.conf depending upon the version of Apache installed -LoadModule php5_module &#8220;E:/apps/php-5.2.3/php5apache2.dll&#8221;<br />
or<br />
LoadModule php5_module &#8220;E:/apps/php-5.2.3/php5apache2_2.dll&#8221;</li>
<li>Add the following line to httpd.conf -AddType application/x-httpd-php .php</li>
<li>Add the following line to httpd.conf -PHPIniDir &#8220;E:/apps/php-5.2.3&#8221;</li>
<li>Add the PHP folder to the Windows PATH variable.</li>
<li>Restart your system after completing the last step to make sure that Apache refreshes the environment values. For some reason this does not happen simply by restarting Apache.</li>
<li>Download and install MySQL.</li>
<li>Change the extension_dir variable in php.ini to point to the complete path to the extensions directory.</li>
<li>Add the following line to php.ini -extension=php_mysqli.dll</li>
<li>In some situations phpMyAdmin also requires the php_mcrypt.dll and php_mbstring.dll extensions enabled. If needed, uncomment their loader lines in php.ini</li>
<li>Copy libmcrypt.dll to %SYSTEM% folder if you need the php_mcrypt.dll extension to work.</li>
</ol>
