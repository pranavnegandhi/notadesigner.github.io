		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>How to Write Unmaintainable Code is a satirical piece of programming advice written by Roedy Green a long time ago. That it remains his most popular essay till date speaks volumes about the programming skills of human society as a whole. Collectively, we are either a massive bunch of shit-chucking apes who take this essay seriously, or a small bunch of highly skilled developers seeking relief from daily disillusionment in our work behind its biting humour.</p>
<p>I hope to hell that it’s the latter.</p>
<p>Green’s essay is written with Java and C programmers in mind, but many of the techniques described can be applied to any programming language. Consider this essay as a ‘lite’ version of Green’s to keep us script kiddies from feeling left out.</p>
<h3>Write code. Or markup. Or both. Together.</h3>
<p>PHP has a very unique ability of allowing the programmer to intersperse program code with HTML markup in the same file by using special PHP tags to identify code blocks. And as with all things PHP, there is more than one way to skin a cat.</p>
<pre>&lt;? echo “Hello, World!”; &gt; // What is referred to as the ‘old style’.

&lt;? echo “Hello, World!”; ?&gt; // What is referred to as the ‘first new style’. Note the added question mark in the end tag.

&lt;?php echo “Hello, World!”; ?&gt; // The ‘second new style’ is similar to the first new style and most recommended

&lt;script language=”php”&gt;
    echo “Hello, World!”; &gt; // What else? The ‘third new style’ of tags
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;% echo “Hello, World!”; %&gt; // And finally, a fourth way that uses ASP-style tags</pre>
<p>This in itself opens whole new avenues for abuse for a programmer used to the sharper separation of code and presentation enforced in a more serious language. What’s worse is that the tag rules can be changed on individual systems through the php.ini file. Develop with all style flags enabled. Tell your colleagues that you’re doing it in the interest of maximum compatibility with third-party libraries. For added fun, find (or write your own) library that liberally switches between all five types of tags and make it an indispensible part of your project. Or keep switching coding standards every few weeks until there’s a healthy mix of all types of PHP tags scattered throughout your code. Refuse to replace previously used styles with the current favourite because it’s better to leave well enough alone.</p>
<p>Do not document this anywhere.</p>
<p>This is in the interest of avoiding single-step deployments on a stock (or sane) PHP installation. Force system administrators to find the problem in your code and then comb through the php.ini file for the appropriate settings. Always say that you have security in mind, which is encouraged by having the system administrator read each line of the settings file.</p>
<p>But the ability of the language to intersperse HTML markup even inside if&#8230;else or loop blocks evidences the sheer the heinousness that must have enveloped the language designers when they wrote that bit of the specification.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to abuse this ‘feature’.</p>
<p>A tamer way would be –</p>
<pre>&lt;?php if (foo == null): ?&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Invalid foo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;? elseif (foo == 1): ?&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foo is too small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;? else ?&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correct foo entered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;?php endif ?&gt;</pre>
<p>A more advanced programmer might use something like this –</p>
<pre>&lt;div class=”query_output”&gt;
    &lt;?
        $sql=”select * from names”;
        if (db_connect()): ?&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Error!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;?php else: ?&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Names&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;?
            $res = db_query($sql);
            $names = db_result($res);
            foreach ($names as $names): ?&gt;
                &lt;!--span&gt;&lt;?php echo $name ?&gt;&lt;/span--&gt;
                &lt;li class=”name”&gt;&lt;? echo $name ?&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;? endforeach; ?&gt;
    &lt;? endif; ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>By closely coupling the business logic with the presentation layer, your manager will have to assign a qualified programmer to make even innocuous changes to the front-end code rather than assign them to a design trainee. Male lions in the wild mark their territory by pissing on trees. Programmers should mark theirs by pissing all over the front-end markup.</p>
<h3>Reinvent the wheel. Poorly</h3>
<p>If there’s one thing that PHP is famous for, it’s the rich selection of extremely useful, but badly named functions in its libraries and standard extensions. Make things worse by ignoring the in-built functions entirely and rolling your own instead. Feign ignorance, which is a pretty valid excuse when talking about PHP because it has extensions for everything you might dream about, and some things you might have never even heard of (can you spell Swish-e?).</p>
<p>Write your functions in the most naïve and inefficient manner possible. You get bonus points if it is error prone due to subtle variations in the input.</p>
<p>For example, PHP has an in-built strtotime() function that can convert ‘about any English textual datetime description into a Unix timestamp’. Ignore it. Take a date/time string and split it into its component values by using hardcoded delimiters. Don’t take regional differences into account. Everybody should just be using ISO 8601 anyways.</p>
<h3>Naming is the key</h3>
<p>Begin programming before the domain model is fully ready or understood. That way you get to create your own colourful terminology for objects which haven’t been named yet. For example, suppose you’re building a web-based interface for a controller in a bakery. Look up the thesaurus for the term ‘mould’ and use an unrelated synonym such as ‘die’ in place of the mould. Repeated instances of the word ‘die’ will make the maintenance programmer wonder if you wanted to pass a subliminal message on to him through your code.</p>
<p>Take this to the next level by using different naming conventions for the same element. If your database field stores the machine operator’s name in a ‘username’ field, store the value in a variable called ‘user_machine_op_curr’, ‘machine_operator_curuser’, ‘machop_current’ and ‘machine_operator_current_user’ in different places where you need the value.</p>
<p>For maximum effect, instead of encapsulating usage of this variable in a single module, apply the RYE principle to litter the code across all the files. Suppose you need a widget to display the active username at the top of the page. Write the query and code to do this on every page with subtle variations in field names and joining random bits of data from unrelated or unneeded tables. The maintenance programmer will have no idea whether the query really needs the other fields, which will dissuade him from refactoring the code into a single module.</p>
<p>Tell everyone who asks that you are caching data for later use in order to improve performance.</p>
<h3>Code formatting is hard. Let’s go shopping.</h3>
<p>Randomize whitespace rules in your project. Use tabs in some places, spaces in another, or you can even mix and match both on the same line. Aggressively prevent any kind of structure from appearing in the code through indentation. Nested if&#8230;else blocks or loops are best for this kind of camouflage. The unwary programmer will not notice a nested loop if it is not indented further than its parent. Compound this complexity with the ability to enter and exit PHP code blocks at random locations within the file.</p>
<h3>Repeat Yourself Everywhere (RYE)</h3>
<p>Functions and objects are for weenies. Duplicating large chunks of badly formatted code all over the project puts hair on your chest. Even if you are a girl.</p>
<p>This is the ultimate abuse of a maintenance programmer in any language. But by effectively combining the previous principles, PHP gives this technique the potential to become a lifelong nightmare of bugs which are hard to find, fix or test.</p>
<h3>Putting on the Pounds</h3>
<p>By diligently following all the pointers given above you can be sure to reach file sizes of magnanimous proportions. The ultimate goal is to make a file large enough to timeout the version control server while a network operation is in progress. Make enough of those and the maintenance programmer will be caught between a hard place and a rock. On one hand, there is the fragility of the code which requires frequent commits to keep from making too big a change. On the other there are constant network errors while trying to commit changes to version control.</p>
<h3>Database Abuse</h3>
<p>PHP’s ultimate utility is its excellent data-processing pedigree. Numerous extensions have been written to enable connecting PHP with different database servers. And the one common thing that all database publishers extol is to consolidate query operations through the use of joins for fewer disk operations and lower network transfer.</p>
<p>Ignore them.</p>
<p>Instead, run multiple queries – one to retrieve the master table and the rest while cycling through the result set to retrieve values from the secondary table, using the current record as the selection criteria. If you have enough values in the master table, this will slow your server down enough to frustrate the end user. Use the techniques mentioned above to obfuscate and entangle your queries with unrelated code to make it resistant to change.</p>
<p>For added joy, create a new connection at random places in your code to the same database server. This will confuse the casual maintenance programmer into thinking that you’re actually retrieving information from two databases, and hence justify you not using a join.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Perform enough of these activities in a single project and you can be assured of months of job security. The best part about working in a language like PHP is that you don’t have to worry about making it not look maintainable. Legions of bad programmers have given the language such a bad rep that people almost expect PHP code to look bad.</p>
<p>Which kind of makes this whole essay moot, though.</p>

		<p>I have been noticing off-late that as a UI developer, I dabble less in what can be considered programming and more often in HTML and CSS and making them work across the bazillion browsers out there. The closest I get to what can be considered writing lines of code is where the interaction requires a few lines of JavaScript to transition a control in or out of the screen or some Ajax operation to send data across the wire or update the view. And even such programming is greatly abstracted away, thanks to frameworks such as jQuery. With the browser taking care of everything, from drawing widgets, to layout, to handling user interaction, there is little left to do other than send the page layout to the browser. Sadly, that is the lot of most UI developers who have been reduced to pixel-pushers in this advent of web-based applications.</p>
<p>Even the folks who develop RIA’s on platforms such as Flash and Silverlight do not feel the need to get into performance oriented code beyond optimizing network requests.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about widgets. Don’t fiddle with the whatchamacallit. Don’t! Don’t! It is all done! Just fetch me another recordset, sonny. And make it snappy!</p>
<p>And though this kind of work does pay the bills, every once in a while someone runs into a problem that cannot be addressed through an API call. When that happens, the first reaction of the average development team is to clutch at their hair and run around in circles screaming “Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!” And though someone on the team usually manages to whack something out over a weekend, it often isn’t the best solution because nobody has done this before! Whereas programmers of yore that I worked with never flinched at getting their hands dirty with low-level stuff, even up to writing custom extensions to their platform in a language like C, many of today’s programmers work on enough abstractions to make the underlying hardware and operating system entirely irrelevant. To them, the browser or virtual machine is the machine.</p>
<h3>Where Does One Draw the Line?</h3>
<p>Let me lead you through a programming exercise using ActionScript that demonstrates the joy of extending missing API calls. We are not inventing new algorithms here, but implementing a simple, well-defined solution for drawing lines on raster displays using the slope-intercept formula. Then we are coming up with a better implementation, using a better algorithm, trading performance and accuracy to reach a balanced result in the end.</p>
<p><div id="swfdfeb1">This movie requires Flash Player 9</div>

</p>
<h3>The Shape of a Line</h3>
<p>For those who do not remember high-school geometry and algebra, a line can be specified by providing its start and end coordinates, using the slope-intercept formula to determine the path between these two points. This information used to be enough to display lines on vector displays of yore, which could draw all sorts of mathematically defined shapes. But with the advent of raster displays which only allow discrete pixels to be turned on, lines and other shapes are now displayed by calculating the pixels which approximate the ideal line as closely as possible.</p>
<p>The slope intercept formula goes as follows –</p>
<p>y = (y1 – y0) / (x1 – x0) * x + b</p>
<p>This is further condensed into –</p>
<p>y = m * x + b</p>
<p>Here m is the slope of the line, which is the ratio of rise against the run. The value b represents the y-intercept, which is the location where the line crosses the origin on the y-axis. So to compute the y-coordinate on any given x-coordinate on that line, you multiply the slope of the line with the x-coordinate and add the y-intercept to the result. To extend this into drawing lines, you would run a loop incrementing a value between the start and end x-coordinates and computing the y-coordinate with each iteration.</p>
<p>Here is an implementation.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">public static function lineSimple(bmdCanvas:BitmapData, x0:int, y0:int, x1:int, y1:int, lColor:uint)
{
	/**
	 * Naive implementation of slope-intercept formula
	 */

	var m:Number;
	var b:Number;
	var dx:Number, dy:Number;

	dx = x1 - x0;
	dy = y1 - y0;

	if (dx != 0)
	{
		m = dy / dx;
		b = y0 - m * x0;
		dx = (x1 &gt; x0) ? 1 : -1;

		while (x0 != x1)
		{
			x0 += dx;
			y0 = m * x0 + b;

			bmdCanvas.setPixel32(x0, y0, lColor);
		}
	}
}</pre>
<p>This is a very straight-forward implementation and leaves a lot to be desired. But let us take it line by line to understand it.</p>
<p>The first 2 lines calculate the difference between the start and end points in both axes. Then it divides dy by dx after checking for a potential ‘Divide by zero’ error and then calculates the slope and the y-intercept of the line. It also changes the value of dx to 1 if the x-coordinate of the second point is greater than the x-coordinate of the first point, or -1 if it is less than.</p>
<p>We now enter the loop which continues until x0 becomes greater than or equal to x1. Inside this loop it increments the value of x0 by dx (1 or -1) and calculates the value of y0 using the slope-intercept formula. It then places a pixel at the newly calculated coordinate and continues the loop.</p>
<p>This is a very simple implementation and just barely does the job. In fact, it does not even cover all possible cases that a line-drawing function might run into. For example, this will not work correctly if the slope of the line is greater than 1 (in other words, if the line is taller than it is wider). As the loop iterates over values in the x-axis, it plots exactly one pixel in every column while possibly plotting more than one pixel in the same row. But when the line becomes steep, there are fewer columns than rows. Since the algorithm iterates over the x-axis and computes the position in the y-axis, the distance between consecutive pixels on the y-axis increases as the line becomes steeper and makes for a discontinuous line.</p>
<h3>Resolution for Slopes Greater than 1 or Negative Slopes</h3>
<p>To resolve this issue, with come up with a second iteration of our line drawing function. This function first calculates the slope of the line and if it is less than 1 then it continues using the previously demonstrated algorithm. But if the slope is greater than 1 or less than -1 then it increments the value of the y-axis in the loop and computes the position in the x-axis. The complete implementation is shown below.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">public static function lineImproved(bmdCanvas:BitmapData, x0:int, y0:int, x1:int, y1:int, lColor:uint)
{
	/**
	 * Advanced implementation of slope-intercept formula
	 * to handle slopes greater than 1 or less than -1
	 */

<p>This program is essentially the same as the previous one but functionally complete to render lines correctly for all possible cases. But there is plenty of room for optimization. Firstly, it uses floating point numbers for what is eventually to be plotted on screen as pixels, which are in whole numbers. Secondly, it computes the value of the next pixel using the slope-intercept formula. This can be optimized away by pre-calculating this equation once out of the loop and then incrementing the value of the row or column in the loop.</p>
<h3>Optimization of Inner Loops</h3>
<pre lang="actionscript">public static function lineDDA(bmdCanvas:BitmapData, x0:int, y0:int, x1:int, y1:int, lColor:uint)
{
	/**
	 * Line drawn using DDA algorithm
	 * Optimizations are made by replacing the repetitive
	 * calculations of the slope-intercept formula in
	 * the loop with 2 division operations outside it
	 * and instead incrementing the values of x and y
	 * variables with these pre-computed numbers
	 * inside the loop
	 */

	var dx:Number, dy:Number;
	var steps:Number;
	var m:Number;
	var x:Number, y:Number;
	var xinc:Number, yinc:Number;

	// Determine the direction of incrementation based on the slope
	dx = x1 - x0;
	dy = y1 - y0;
	if (Math.abs(dx) &gt; Math.abs(dy))
		steps = Math.abs(dx);
	else
		steps = Math.abs(dy);

	// Calculate the incrementation for each axes
	xinc = dx / steps;
	yinc = dy / steps;

	x = x0;
	y = y0;

	for (var i:Number = 1; i &lt; steps; i++)
	{
		x += xinc;
		y += yinc;
		bmdCanvas.setPixel32(x, y, lColor);
	}
}</pre>
<p>This algorithm does not use the slope-intercept formula at all. Instead, it calculates the difference between the start and end points and increments the position on both axes in the loop. Whereas calculating the y-coordinate with the slope-intercept formula requires the use of one multiplication and one addition, incrementing the y-coordinate only requires a single addition operation, which makes it blazingly fast.</p>
<h3>Further Speed Gains</h3>
<p>Floating point operations are desirable for plotting on vector graphics terminals because they are capable for drawing a continuous line. But when using raster displays, which only allow plotting discrete points to approximate a true line, floating point data becomes redundant. Thus, if we can find a way to compute a line using only integers, we can speed up our algorithm, while not losing any substantial information because the pixels used to approximate the line are whole numbers anyway.</p>
<p>Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm uses integers to plot a line on the screen. An implementation is shown below.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">public static function lineBresenham2(bmdCanvas:BitmapData, x0:int, y0:int, x1:int, y1:int, lColor:uint)
{
	var dx:int;
	var dy:int;
	var stepx:int
	var stepy:int;
	var counter:int

	// Calculate the difference between the start and end coordinates
	dx = x1 - x0;
	dy = y1 - y0;

	// Determine the direction of the increment in both axes
	if (dx &lt; 0)
	{
		dx = -dx;
		stepx = -1;
	}
	else
	{
		stepx = 1;
	}

	if (dy &lt; 0)
	{
		dy = -dy;
		stepy = -1;
	}
	else
	{
		stepy = 1;
	}

	bmdCanvas.setPixel32(x0, y0, lColor);

	dx &lt;&lt;= 1;
	dy &lt;&lt;= 1;

	if (dx &gt; dy)
	{
		/** Line is wider than it is taller */

		/**
		 * Counter is used to track the number of times
		 * dx is divisible by dy. The value of dy is
		 * repeatedly subtracted from it on every iteration
		 * until it becomes less than or equal to 0.
		 * When that happens, the y-coordinate is incremented
		 * by stepy and counter is reset to dx.
		 */
		counter = dx;

		while (x0 != x1)
		{
			/**
			 * Increment the y-coordinate by stepy when
			 * the counter becomes less than 0
			 */
			if (counter &lt;= 0)
			{
				y0 += stepy;
				counter += dx;
			}

			// Increment the x-coordinate on every iteration
			x0 += stepx;

			// Reduce the counter by dy
			counter -= dy;

			bmdCanvas.setPixel32(x0, y0, lColor);
		}
	}
	else
	{
		/** Line is taller than it is wider */

		counter = dy &gt;&gt; 1;

		while (y0 != y1)
		{
			if (counter &lt;= 0)
			{
				x0 += stepx;
				counter += dy;
			}

			y0 += stepy;
			counter -= dx;

			bmdCanvas.setPixel32(x0, y0, lColor);
		}
	}
}</pre>
<p>Division here is implemented as a series of continuous subtractions. The initial value of the variable fraction is set to dx. Assuming that the line is to be plotted from 0,0 to 100, 10, the values of dx and dy are 100 and 10, respectively. Thus, fraction is assigned the value 100. The variables x0 and y0 are the starting coordinates of the line. With each iteration of the loop, x0 is increased by 1 and the value of dy subtracted from fraction. When the fraction becomes less than or equal to 0, the y-coordinate is incremented by 1 and the counter reset to dx. The variable dy can be subtracted from counter dx / dy times before it becomes less than or equal to 0, making it a brute-force form of division.</p>

<p>It is no secret that I am a big fan of the Navigator bicycle. Although it is not a top of the line product, it hits a sweet spot between features, comfort and affordability. There are times when I crib about the less than stellar performance of many of its components. But that cribs quickly die down after I consider that better performance would involve unpleasant tasks like spending money.</p>
<div id="attachment_240" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/a-bicycle-like-no-other/navigator-brakes/" rel="attachment wp-att-240"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-240" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-240" title="Cheap-ass local brake levers" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/navigator-brakes-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-240" class="wp-caption-text">Cheap-ass local brake levers</p></div>
<p>At the time of purchase I had also hoped it would be less of an attention getter than a Trek or Merida. But I can safely say that is misguided hope because the Navigator is definitely a class better in design, style and finish than other Indian brands and easily sticks out in a crowd. But I still do leave it unattended in public areas at times with just a cable lock to hold it down and thankfully, have always returned to find it as I had left it. I am pretty certain that a Bianchi Aeron or a Merida Crossway left like that on the busy streets of Sadashiv Peth would disappear faster than bank executives after a bailout.</p>

<h3>Big Man on a Little Bike and Other Justifications</h3>
<p>It took some time for my interest to deepen in bicycling enough to consider things like fitting. But a chat with Rajesh Nair after a ride around Pune found me fumbling with body measurements and running the numbers through an online fit calculator. A few minutes later, the bearded old man working at the Competitive Cyclist announced his verdict. The Navigator was at least 2 centimetres smaller than what would be an ideal size for me.</p>
<div id="attachment_244" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/a-bicycle-like-no-other/navigator-rear-shifter/" rel="attachment wp-att-244"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-244" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-244" title="Ultegra rear shifters (can be run indexed or in friction mode)" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/navigator-rear-shifter-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-244" class="wp-caption-text">Ultegra rear shifters (can be run indexed or in friction mode)</p></div>
<p>This explained all the shoulder pain that I had been experiencing after long or fast-paced rides. The upright posture was also inefficient due to increased resistance in windy conditions, and although I was not very certain at that time, there was a gut feeling that the stooped posture on drops would increase pedalling power.</p>
<p>Unlike popular misconception, riding in the drops does not give a person a bad back. On the contrary, riding upright is the problem, as described by Sheldon Brown (all hail!).</p>
<blockquote><p>When riding a bicycle, the back should be arched, like a bridge, not drooping forward between the hips and the shoulders. If the back is properly arched, bumps will cause it to flex slightly in the direction of a bit more arch; this is harmless. If you ride swaybacked, bumps will cause the back to bow even farther in the forward direction, which can lead to severe lumbar pain. Some back-pain sufferers modify their bicycles with extra-high handlebars so that they can sit bolt upright, with their spines straight. This is actually counterproductive in most cases, because a straight spine has no way to &#8220;give&#8221; when the bike hits bumps. Road irregularities will jam the vertebrae together, often aggravating existing back problems. The bolt-upright posture is comfortable if you&#8217;re sitting stationary on the bike, but is not suitable for riding much faster than a brisk walk. Riders who for some reason require such a position should use some form of suspension&#8230;a sprung saddle at the very least.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, I was missing the bar-ends on my previous bicycle and the multiple grips they offered. They made for more comfortable hands and wrists and were an absolute boon on long rides. It would be nice to have the ability to change grips again after the modification.</p>
<h3>Beware! There be Dragons in here.</h3>
<p>It actually makes little sense to put a bike through extensive modifications like changing handlebars. It is expensive, time consuming and opens a wide window of opportunity for unscrupulous dealers to rip you off. If you have a choice between modding an existing bike and buying a new one, it makes more fiscal sense to make a new purchase. But if you are cramped for options or just plain sadistic, let us delve further into the pitfalls.</p>
<p>Purchasing spares in retail is very expensive. And most of the awesome gizmos are not available at local dealers. Which means you will be begging your Ramesh Uncle from Atlanta to bring your bar-end shifters when he returns for his annual homecoming and pray he gets the model numbers right, or else order online and get doorstep delivery.</p>
<p>Each strategy has its pros and cons. Ramesh Uncle might gift your ‘cycling kit’ to you for free, but you have to risk receiving MTB grips instead of shifters because he would not know a shifter if it came and bit his ass. You won’t face that problem with an online purchase, but the associated cost of delivery is going to send the effective cost into the stratosphere, maybe even more than what you paid for the entire bike when you bought it new.</p>
<p>Finally, if the store owner you approach for this modification does not have a conscience, he will gladly lighten your wallet by overcharging you for spares and labour or giving your spurious spares, so your ‘Shimano’ brake levers will last all of 2 weeks or until the first time you press them real hard in an emergency, more in line with typical Chinese-made ‘Shivamo’ products.</p>
<p>So, work hard at learning the mechanics, brand names, model numbers, prices and warranty before even approaching a dealer. Then, when he spouts some bullshit about thumb shifters costing Rs. 1000 apiece, you can call it.</p>
<div id="attachment_241" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/a-bicycle-like-no-other/navigator-computer/" rel="attachment wp-att-241"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-241" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-241" title="Cateye Strada cycle-computer (recommended!)" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/navigator-computer-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-241" class="wp-caption-text">Cateye Strada cycle-computer (recommended!)</p></div>
<p>You must study, study and study some more, followed by a written examination and a trial by fire before getting into any such stuff. If you are fortunate enough to have access to more established high-end cycling communities and dealers then you can be exempted from the examination and trial by fire because chances are the service technicians know what they are doing. But since their counterparts in India often believe that the hammer is the solution to all derailleur alignment problems, you need to make up for their knowledge gaps. It helps to be physically present at the store to keep an eye on what shenanigans the bike store employees are up to with your mobile, to lend a hand for some of the simpler tasks and maybe picking up a few pointers along the way.</p>
<h3>Making Change Happen</h3>
<p>Over several months of reading about a handlebar conversion, the one sentiment that echoed repeatedly was that aero brake levers would not work well with the direct pull brakes on my bike. I kept that information at the back of my mind though, because the dealers I met to consult and cost-compare all assured me that they would make the twain work together like old friends. For what it&#8217;s worth, I&#8217;m still riding that way and happen to find no serious problems so far. But don&#8217;t take my word for it.</p>
<p>I handed the bike over to the care of the mechanics at Surendar Cycles, hoping to pick it up a few days later. There was a bit of a let-down because they were not able to deliver on time because spares could not be sourced easily. The handlebar and bar tape were purchased from Firefox Bikes. I settled for cheap, aero brake levers. And for shifters, I initially had to go with locally made Starlit thumb shifters. These would have been fine, except that they took up prime real estate on the top of the bar, leaving little room for the computer.</p>
<p>I chose the Firefox alloy handlebar over a locally made steel bar to trim weight. It works and there are options in the market at both ends of this one. Cheaper steel bars can do if you are in a pinch, or if you have money to spare, more high end ergo-bars can make for a more comfortable ride. Take your pick.</p>
<p>We also ordered Firefox bar-tape, but it ripped to shreds within the first 2 weeks. I could have easily avoided this expensive mistake by reading some reviews online beforehand. But you can learn from my experience and need not make the same mistake.</p>
<p>Finally, for some unexplained reason, the service folks installed 6-indexed rear shifters for both front and rear derailleurs. As a result, the shifter connected to the front would be highly tensed at the highest setting. A normal rear shifter expects no pull from the cables at its highest setting because they are at their slackest at that point. Because the conditions were now reversed (highest setting, maximum cable pull), the slightest bump or turning the handlebar too much would cause the cable to pull hard on the shifter mechanism and make it jump to a lower setting. This was not an ideal situation to be in and downright dangerous when cornering at high speed on tight turns.</p>
<p>The alternative was to purchase a good set of quality shifters myself. I could not wait for or trust anyone returning from abroad to get the correct shifters for me. I also had a strong dislike for thumb shifters now because they just did not complement the drop bars. After a lot of soul searching, seeking advice on forums and intense meditation on my bank account and the potential impact on my pension portfolio over the next 40 years, I decided to spring for entry level Shimano Ultegra 64 8-speed bar-end shifters.</p>
<p>Evans Cycles has the best deals for these shifters. At £52, and Evans free shipping policy for goods over £50, these were affordable. I threw in Cinelli bar tape for £8 to replace the already worn out Firefox tape and condemned my frugal self to eternal guilt of extravagance.</p>
<h3>Real Men Don’t Index</h3>
<p>The shifters were delivered exactly a week later. Instead of taking them to Surendar Cycles though, I rode out to Rider Owned Bicycles at Koregaon Park. I had been hearing about them for very long and wanted to try out their service and expertise for a simple project like this one.</p>
<p>The bar-end shifters are special in that they only support friction mode for the front shifter and either indexed or friction shifting for the rear shifter. After a few mismatched shifts in indexed mode, probably because I am still stuck with a 7-speed Tourney cassette, I switched over entirely to friction mode. It seems a bit daunting before you actually try it. But friction mode is really not very different from indexed shifting when performance isn’t high on the priorities. I don’t think I will regret this decision.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>The conversion has been one of the best decisions I made since purchasing the Navigator. The shifters do hike up the purchase price of the bike quite a bit. But the cost is more than repaid with the comfort, looks and performance post conversion. My lower-back and shoulders hurt no more even after a longish ride. I can attribute the first to drooped posture and the second to the increased reach facilitated by the drop bars. I have been taking it out for spins for a month now and hope to send it through a more thorough grind in the next several days.</p>
<p>The shifters did increase the cost of the bike substantially. Looking harder would have uncovered cheaper shifters such as old Suntour&#8217;s. But considering that I was mid-way through a conversion, with my bike completely unusable because of the unreliable performance of the Starlit shifters (due blame on the mechanics for this boo-boo too), I had to rush through the best available option. Bringing all spares together beforehand will ensure a smoother conversion for you.</p>
<p>If LA Sovereign or an add-on provider sold off-the-shelf conversion kits, this task would be much easier. It could probably consist of the drop bar, shifters, brake levers, centre-pull brakes, accessories to go along with these components (cables, hooks, screws, etc.), all priced reasonably. I see no problem in this approach, because with the mudguards and rear-rack that the Navigator comes with, it effectively would convert it into a low-end touring bike. The only other road bike that LA Sovereign has in its line-up is the Urbano, which is more than twice the cost of this bike. But with no facility for mudguards and a rear rack on it, there is hardly any chance of overlapping user requirements. LA Sovereign can continue to target performance bikers with the Urbano while catering to the needs of commuters and tourers with the Navigator and an optional conversion kit.</p>

		<h3>Early Morning</h3>
<p>Being inspired by Sudipto’s ride last Sunday, I had planned my own trip down to Lonavala on Thursday. The plan had to be shelved because we were up till late on Wednesday night following the situation in Mumbai. But I had an itch and it needed scratching. So I realigned my plans for Saturday.</p>
<p>The original idea was to leave early by 5:30 in the morning. Lonavala is just a couple of hours ride from here, so I could be there by early morning, have breakfast and return by around lunchtime. But I overslept instead, and it was 7:00 by the time I was ready to leave. Being late however turned out to be good for me. It had been raining earlier in the morning and riding through the cold rain wouldn’t have been a very pleasant experience.</p>
<p>I donned a jacket to keep out the cold and took off. It was well past daybreak and there was no need for additional lights on the bike. The dynamo on my bike had anyway been damaged earlier and I was not very keen on wasting time attaching the lights from my wife’s bike onto my own. I could feel the nip in the air even as I carried the bike downstairs. The cold air struck my bare legs as I began to ride. Winter’s here, I thought to myself.</p>
<div id="attachment_230" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/ride-to-lions-point/lions-point-climb/" rel="attachment wp-att-230"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-230" title="lions-point-climb" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-climb-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-230" class="wp-caption-text">Climbing up to Lion&#8217;s Point</p></div>
<p>The journey up to Lonavala itself was rather uneventful. I clipped along at a steady 20 km/h and stopped for a bite every hour. It was yet quite cold and the warm missal-pao at 8:30 am provided welcome relief. I was just beyond Vadgaon and just a few kilometres away from Kamshet Ghat. During my previous trips to Lonavala on the Exodus, I had been unable to ride up this incline and had to resort to pushing the bike up. But I was confident that the Navigator would change the equation entirely.</p>
<p>And I wasn’t disappointed. Even more fun was the long slope at the other side of the hump. A light road bike really is a pleasure to ride in such conditions.</p>
<h3>Reaching Lonavala</h3>
<p>Once past Kamshet, the road turns into a very gentle incline towards Lonavala. This had to be the easiest ten kilometres of the trip. A strong crosswind blew from the right, but didn’t hamper progress much. It was chilly and overcast though and there wasn’t even a glimpse of the sun even though it was past 9:00 am. I left the jacket on.</p>
<p>I reached Lonavala exactly at 10:00 in the morning. The odometer read 60 kilometres. The main market of Lonavala had already gone by and I was on the road leading to Bhushi Dam. There was no planned destination in my mind and it seemed quite silly now to just cross the market and come back. This wasn’t exactly a shopping trip.</p>
<p>I munched upon a few biscuits while ruminating upon my further plan of action. Curious passers-by stared or waved at me while I waited at the corner. There were few tourists on this road and the ones who did pass by in their cars cheered or waved past. Hunger satiated, I mounted the bike again and began to ride towards Bhushi Dam. The dam itself is a little off the road and attracts many visitors during the monsoons when it overflows. But this was off-season and it would probably be dry. No other vehicles passed me by till I reached the village near the dam.</p>
<h3>Destination – Lions Point</h3>
<p>Since I had no interest in stopping at Bhushi Dam, I continued to ride further on. There were two navy and air-force installations further down the road so I was expecting some sort of end-of-the-road sign ahead. Surprisingly, no such thing happened. The road branched off towards the navy base a little further, leaving me with more roads to explore. And signs began to welcome me to Amby Valley.</p>
<p>I now had a new destination in mind.</p>
<div id="attachment_232" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/ride-to-lions-point/lions-point-view/" rel="attachment wp-att-232"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-232" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-232" title="lions-point-view" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-view-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-232" class="wp-caption-text">View from the top</p></div>
<p>However, a huge climb lay between the valley and me. Cars and motorbikes zoomed past at several kilometres an hour while I crept along in single digit speeds. I stopped several times to catch my breath before finally giving up and began pushing the bike up till I reached the air-force station at the top of the hill. Once there, I mounted again and began to enjoy the relatively flatter terrain. At one point I noticed a sign indicating a spot called Lion’s Point. I dropped the idea of going all the way into the valley again at the other side and having to face another treacherous climb on the way back and instead aimed to turn back at this spot.</p>
<p>I rolled into a flat open space by the roadside just as the odometer touched 70 kilometres. “Lions Point” – the sign read. The wind was blowing wildly. It was a steep drop from the edge of the cliff. My bicycle and backpack had to be held down to prevent them from taking a leaping dive down. I pushed the bike a little away from the edge behind a locked down handcart and tied it there. I then set off to explore the views and take some pictures of the breathtaking surroundings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/ride-to-lions-point/lions-point-bicycle/" rel="attachment wp-att-229"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-229" title="lions-point-bicycle" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lions-point-bicycle-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>There was nothing to hear except the whistling of the winds. Even the chirping of the birds was drowned in this sound. Then all of sudden the wind died down I was startled by a whining sound behind me which turned out to be a dog, probably expecting a treat. But it was scared away when I jumped 3 feet up in the air in surprise.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<h3>The Return Journey</h3>
<p>I picked up my bag and camera and headed back to the bike. It was nearing 1 in the afternoon and I was dying for a bite. The ride down was fascinating and I zipped down in a few minutes. A motorcycle rider headed in the opposite direction was taken aback when he saw me coming down a curve and hollered out. Some of the locals from Bhushi village gathered to wave out from the sides of the road. One of the kids coming from the opposite direction on a bicycle shouted gleefully, “Racing! Racing! Good luck.” I smiled and waved back.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later I was back in Lonavala market, tucking into a meal.</p>
<p>At 2 pm, I began the ride back to Pune. I was now faced with a double whammy – the gentle incline in the road till Kamshet meant I was going to be riding upwards for most of this road. To make things difficult, the crosswinds had changed direction and were now coming on at me from the full-front. My speed dropped down to between 10-12 kilometres an hour and I had to stop for a break every half an hour or so. I was beginning to fear what effort the Kamshet climb would entail.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the winds died down during the uphill at the ghat, but came back double quick on the other side of the hump. The lull in the headwinds had probably been because the mountain itself shielded me from them. I had to stop pedalling on the other side and focus only on keeping the bike straight, such was the force of the winds.</p>
<p>Conditions remained like this for practically the rest of the way up to Bhakti-Shakti Chowk at Nigdi – a full 50 kilometres from the outskirts of Lonavala. The highway was now packed with traffic and motorcycle riders would pass by slowly wondering what kind of crazy creature had been let loose here. Some waved. I finally gave up riding at the outskirts of Nigdi – about a kilometre before the Bhakti-Shakti Chowk and began pushing the bike through the dirt at the side of the road. Not only was I tired, but the two-lane road was getting filled with agitated drivers racing against each other. Several times I saw cars from the opposite side coming into my lane and heading towards me at breathtaking speeds, turning back into their lanes just metres ahead of me.</p>
<p>Once back on a real road, I took upon the bike again with gusto. The buildings surrounding me broke the winds finally and I was able to pick up a decent pace again. It was 15 kilometres from here to home.</p>
<p>I covered the rest of the distance in an hour, mainly slowing down near Kasarwadi due to traffic.</p>
<p>It was 6 by the time I reached home – 11 hours since I left. The odometer read 141 kilometres.</p>

		<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="https://notadesigner.com/difference-between-a-pointer-and-a-pointer-to-pointer-in-c/" rel="bookmark">Difference Between a Pointer and a Pointer-to-pointer in C</a></h1>
	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>C passes variables by value. So if you pass 2 int’s x and y to the function square(), it creates a copy of both variables, populates them with the same value as x and y and hands them over to the function to process.</p>
<pre lang="c">int square(int x, int y)
{
  return x * y;
}

int main(void)
{
  square(a, b);
}</pre>
<p>The same thing happens with pointers. A char *a points to location 0x000000 (or NULL) in memory. The variable is then passed to a function initString(). Now a copy of the pointer is created, which also points to the value 0x000000 and is processed by the initString() function. Within initString(), new memory is allocated using malloc() to the variable a.</p>
<pre lang="c">void initString(char *x)
{
  x = malloc(6 * sizeof(char));
  sprintf(x, "%s", "Hello");
}

int main(void)
{
  char *a = NULL;
  initString(a);

  printf("%s\n", a);
}</pre>
<p>Output</p>
<pre lang="dos">(null)</pre>
<p>What happens in this case is that a fresh pointer variable is created, which happens to point at the same location as a, which is initially NULL. Then memory is allocated to this pointer in the initString() function, so it begins to point to the location returned by malloc(). When the function returns, the x variable is destroyed (and the memory allocated to it is now unreferenced, which creates a memory leak). In the meantime, a is still pointing to NULL.</p>
<p>Now let us change the signature of the initString() function.</p>
<pre lang="c">void initString(char **x)
{
  *x = malloc(6 * sizeof(char));
  sprintf(*x, "%s", "Hello");
}

int main(void)
{
  char *a = NULL;

  initString(&amp;a);
  printf("%s\n", a);
}</pre>
<p>Output</p>
<pre lang="dos">Hello</pre>
<p>In this case, a is still pointing to NULL. However, instead of passing a directly, initString() is handed over a reference to the pointer a – a pointer to a pointer. This causes a pointer variable to be created which points to the memory location of a. Now, the dereference operator (*) can be used to locate the address of a. Thus the memory address returned by malloc() can be assigned to a.</p>
<p>This method is not needed if you have already allocated memory to a char array in the calling function. This is because the pointer parameter in the callee function also refers to the same memory address allocated in the caller function.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick working example that demonstrates the differences between a pointer and a pointer-to-pointer when passed on to a function.</p>
<pre lang="c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void initString1(char *a)
{
  a = malloc(6 * sizeof(char));
  strcpy(a, "Hello");
  printf("initString1():\t%s\t%p\t%p\n", a, a, &amp;a);
}

void initString2(char **a)
{
  *a = malloc(6 * sizeof(char));
  strcpy(*a, "World");
  printf("initString2():\t%s\t%p\t%p\n", *a, *a, &amp;*a);
}

int main(int argc, int *argv[])
{
  char *b = NULL;

  printf("Function |\tValue\tPoints to\tAddress\n", b, b, &amp;b);
  initString1(b);
  //strcpy(b, "World"); // Crashes
  printf("main() :\t%s\t%p\t%p\n", b, b, &amp;b);

  initString2(&amp;b);
  strcpy(b, "Hello");
  printf("main() :\t%s\t%p\t%p\n", b, b, &amp;b);

  return 0;
}</pre>

		<p>At 4:35, I was practically gasping for some fresh air. It had been a long day, and I was in no mood to be cooped up at my desk. Not being able to rein in the bug-list worsened things. I threw in the towel at 4:40. Screw it. Life was calling and I wasn&#8217;t going to let it pass by.</p>
<p>At 4:40 I was on my bike racing away from office. Anywhere! In my mind I planned to visit the new Baner road again, touch Sadanand Hotel and be back in half an hour. It quickly corrected course though and replanned the route to head instead in the opposite direction towards the lush green DRDO estate. This road would lead into the Bombay-Bangalore bypass from where I could merge back into Baner, take in the new road one more time and then return back to work. It would probably take closer to an hour. Ahhh! That&#8217;s better.</p>
<p>20 minutes later I was riding gaily through DRDO, taking in the cool late afternoon clime. I kept an easy pace and did some math in my head about wheel sizes and speeds. But at no time was I missing out on the view though. Necklace Garden was a welcome sight with its beautifully manicured and freshly watered lawns. It ended all too soon though and I had to turn off towards the bypass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weak bridge. Heavy vehicles not allowed.&#8221;, the sign read. I hoped the Navigator would cut it through and sailed across, right in the middle of the highway.</p>
<p>The road inclined upwards gently past Pashan Lake. The only sound was of the chain whirring and the wheels spinning. Trucks rumbled by occasionally. I was at the top of the incline, just before the Pashankar Showroom &#8211; my favourite spot on this road. I smiled and let the wheels do their thing. What followed was an exhilarating experience of sheer simplicity. The bike picked up pace and was quickly running in the low forties while I held on and enjoyed the thrill.</p>
<p>I was already much feeling much better.</p>
<p>I turned off the bypass into Baner and continued to sit back until the inclines turned northwards again. Even then, I kept an easy pace and enjoyed the warmth of the setting sun behind me.</p>
<p>I was back in my seat exactly an hour later. Nerves soothed, it was back to the grind. But with a smile this time.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>God bless America.</p>
<p>We have more American holidays on our company calendar than local ones, probably because most of our business comes from our fair-faced brethren, who would be working over Diwali and Gandhi Jayanti, but probably not on Christmas or in this case, Columbus Day. Since the missus caters to more local demographics and would be working, I had a day to myself to do as I pleased.</p>
<p>Gautam Raja had pointed out earlier that a century ride was a very American concept and hence often assumed to be in miles. This came about during conversation about my previous trip to Khandala-Pargaon when I gloated about completing a century and a half &#8211; 150 kilometers &#8211; in a single day. Missing out the century-mile accomplishment by a very narrow margin really got my goat and I decided to remedy the problem. And I decided to take off again towards Pargaon, and maybe even further towards Panchgini just to prove what a bad-ass rider I was.</p>
<h3>The Heart of the City</h3>
<p>The route till Panchgini goes well over 60 miles in one direction. In an attempt to reduce the distance a bit I changed it to cut across the city and into Katraj instead of taking the longer route over the Bangalore-Bombay bypass. This was a decision that I was to regret all day.</p>
<p>The National Highway goes through the heart of the city from Shivajinagar, Shanivarwada Fort, Kasba Peth, Budhwar Peth, Shukrawar Peth, Swar Gate and into Katraj. The road varies from rough rubble in Budhwar Peth to concrete stretches at Katraj. I left home at 5:30 in the morning and headed off towards Ganeshkhind Road. There were shorter routes to Shivajinagar but I put safety ahead and took the longer, better lit road instead. For the first time since we moved here I saw the fountains at Bremen Chowk actually functioning and illuminated &#8211; a pleasant side effect of the ongoing Commonwealth Youth Games. The newly installed fountains at University Chowk were also running, although the cops seen the evening before were absent and traffic moved on of its own accord.</p>
<p>I hit the highway at Shivajinagar at about 5:45 and was surprised by the amount of traffic already on the road in spite of the early hour &#8211; mostly rickshaws ferrying travellers to various bus stands across the city.</p>
<p>I really cannot make up my mind about whether the games are good for the city or not.</p>
<p>On one hand, large portions of the city have been given a makeover to cast a good impression upon our foreign guests. For a change, signals are working and even being enforced. And the general presence of so many pretty tourists really does wonders to boost ones morale, especially when you are sporting a sleek conversation-starter bicycle.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is this massive wastage that seems to happen everywhere I go. The Pune Municipal Corporation apparently missed the memo about the ongoing power-crunch affecting Maharashtra. Fountains running late into the night are one thing. But having them running well into the next morning just does not make sense. Especially when you stop to consider that the signals right next to them are promptly switched off from 9 in the night till 8 the next morning. And let us not even talk about the gravy train that the road-repair contractors have been riding upon since the last year.</p>
<p>In the midst of these thoughts I passed the PMC Headquarters and was shocked to see the entire complex lit up with fairy lights. Great! Just great. Entire villages in the state can&#8217;t have a 10 watt light bulb to light up their roads after sundown and these guys were having a party. The freshly cleaned and illuminated fountain at Shanivarwada Fort a little further down the road paled in comparison.</p>
<p>Most people who know me are pretty certain that there is little room in my life for religion and rituals. But there is this bit of faith deep inside me that keeps the flame burning in troubled times. And this faith drew me into a detour into Kasba Peth just outside the Ganpati mandir there. This temple was installed around 1639 by Queen Jijabai Bhosale, the mother of Shivaji and the idol is venerated as the presiding deity of the city. During the annual Ganesh festival, the Kasba Ganapati idol is the first amongst the five &#8220;Manache Ganapati&#8221; of Pune which lead the immersion procession over Laxmi Road. What makes this place special for me is its beautiful wooden construction and serene atmosphere. Stepping over the threshold of this temple is enough to transport a person back into times long gone. It is a great place to hole into while being lost in your thoughts.</p>
<p>This morning though I simply stopped outside the temple doors and shot up a quick prayer. And I was off again.</p>
<p>The rest of the ride was uneventful. Budhwar Peth and Shukrawar Peth looked completely different, devoid as they were of bustling crowds and overwhelming traffic. The sky too had begun to don its mantle of blue by now. But all was yet quiet and only few lights flickered in the closely packed buildings on either side of the narrow road. The only sound was of the chain whirring and the cable lock rattling against the rear rack. I rode on quietly.</p>
<p>The silence disappeared all too suddenly as I found myself surrounded by black fumes and dirty buses at Swar Gate bus stand. The smell of diesel was thick in the air and all I wanted to do was get out double-quick. The traffic too was problematic, made up as it was of errant rickshaws, 6-seaters and unmindful state transport buses. One of those behemoths could run over me in an instant and not even realize it till much later. I flipped the bird at a few drivers then quickly got out of their way.</p>
<p>The traffic died down just as quickly as it started though and I was back onto quiet roads. Thankfully the road widened significantly and had an improved surface. School students and newspaper delivery boys began to crisscross my path on their own bikes. Some looked at me and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Race aahe, race!&#8221; &#8211; It is a race, I heard someone shout.</p>
<p>Obviously, they did not know that the Commonwealth Youth Games did not have a cycling event in their itinerary.</p>
<h3>Beyond Familiar Territory</h3>
<p>The road had now begun to climb rapidly. By the time I reached Bharatiya Vidyapeeth, I was huffing away in a low 2nd gear. Banners all over the place welcomed President Pratibha Patil, who had just days ago been given a honorary Doctor of Letters degree by this university, which kind of sucks when compared to former President Kalam&#8217;s degree in aeronautical engineering and 30 honorary doctorates. I love that guy. And I hate this one just as much.</p>
<p>I made it over the slope finally and heaved a sigh of relief. My relief was shortlived though, because the gradient quickly picked up again after the Katraj Bus Stand. To make things worse, the recent monsoons had taken a heavy toll on the road and at that point I would have gladly traded the Navigator for a bike with good shock absorbers instead. Front and rear ones, please. I crawled along uphill in single-digit speeds for about a kilometre before finally giving up and dismounting.</p>
<p>It was around 7 now and the sun was beginning to be seen over the tops of the mountains. There was quite a nip in the air yet, though and everything was wrapped in fog. I glanced over the edge of the road onto the valley below and saw lush green fields interspersed with patches of bright orange flowers. This called for a picture. When I removed my backpack for the camera, I noticed the vapour rising off my own perspiration-soaked back. Crazy!</p>
<p>I was ready to move on after some pictures. The road kept changing fast between good and mediocre and I alternated between riding and pushing. The climb continued to get more intense. Riding in low gear was affecting the stability of the bike too causing me to weave over the road in order to maintain my balance at slow speed. With all the buses and taxis passing by at high-speed, such behaviour was an invitation for trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accident Prone Area&#8221;, the sign read, followed by a steep 180 degree curve. A gaping hole in the guard wall indicated the spot where some unwary driver had ploughed his vehicle off the road into the bushes, or worse, the valley beyond. I was glad that the cycle would never be able to do such damage, but only for a second when it struck me that crossing paths with an over speeding truck probably would leave me much worse off than the wall. I shook off those thoughts from my mind and stopped to take in the breathtaking scenery and some pictures.</p>
<p>The apex of this climb was the Old Katraj Tunnel. I half-rode and half-pushed my way up the steep ghats for the next half hour before reaching the mouth of the tunnel. At a measly 300 metres long, it was a disappointment. The new tunnel on the Bangalore-Bombay bypass is easily a kilometre or so longer than this one. I flicked on the dynamo just to be safe, even though I could clearly see every inch of the road right up to the other end and rolled through quickly.</p>
<h3>Sunshine Highway</h3>
<p>The view at the other side was completely different. The road was very well laid, and outlined clearly by the same orange flowers I had seen earlier in the valley. The sun too had come up higher since my first break on the ghats and the mist had dissipated. The orange from the backlit flowers cast a beautiful shade on the road ahead and all seemed well again.</p>
<div id="attachment_217" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/katraj-tunnel.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-217" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/katraj-tunnel-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="katraj-tunnel" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-217" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-217" class="wp-caption-text">Sunshine Highway; Katraj</p></div>
<p>I stopped for a few pictures before moving on.</p>
<p>Soon the highway merged into the Bangalore-Bombay bypass. The bike finally was able to pick on some speed on the concrete and half an hour later I had brought my dismal average of 15 km/h at the mouth of the tunnel to a more respectable 19 km/h. My speed on the new road stayed in the early 30&#8217;s through this time.</p>
<p>I halted at 8:00 sharp for breakfast and a quick call to my wife. I was not hungry really, but went ahead and ordered an idli. It was a long day ahead and I would need all the energy I could get. After refilling my water bottles, I hit the road again.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I flicked on the radio and plugged it into one ear. This was to be my companion the rest of the day.</p>
<p>I covered several kilometres over the next hour before the next water-break. It was beginning to get warm now and staying hydrated became a priority.</p>
<h3>Whoops!</h3>
<p><em>Sab Sud-Budh-Hosh Gavaa Ke,<br />
</em><em>Deewani, Main Paagal, Main Jhalli Ho Gayi.<br />
</em><em>Main Talli, Main Talli, Main Talli Ho Gayi</em></p>
<p>Hard Kaur screeched out of the earphones just as I noticed by bicycle act<br />
up.</p>
<p>I noticed a distinct bump with every turn of the wheel. At first I thought it might have to do something with an uneven road surface. When it persisted, I assumed it was a bent rim and stopped to investigate.</p>
<p>Luckily it was only a flat. I was not carrying my patch kit (another decision I would soon regret) but since I had stopped practically next to a bicycle repair shop that was not much of a bother. I was near Narsapur, just a little ahead of the toll booth.</p>
<p>The mechanic quickly patched the tube and I was on my way again. I had lost half an hour but was confident of catching up soon.</p>
<p>The road was undulating, but the bike managed to go at a steady 25-30 km/h throughout. Stopping frequently for water and bananas or a chocolate bar, I managed to keep my energy levels up. In no time at all, I was at Shirwal, the last major town on this route and home to what is probably the only theatre for a radius of 50 kilometres around. Minnisha Lamba looked down adoringly upon my Navigator while Imran Khan pointed his gun threateningly. Sanjay Dutt continued his melancholy stare into emptiness.</p>
<p>The downhill gradient of the road so far now began to tilt upwards again. Khandala was about 5 kilometres away and I would have been able to do it in a few minutes. Then I noticed that my speed seemed incredibly slow. It was taking tremendous effort to go uphill and the bike stopped rolling even when going downhill if I stopped pedalling. This could mean just one thing &#8211; a flat. Again. Yup. Front tyre. And this time there was no mechanic within an arms reach.</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t even a hut for 5 kilometres in either direction. So I dismounted again and pushed the rest of the way to Khandala. And being a small village, finding help was difficult. The mechanics on the highway only worked on motor vehicles. I was sent further into the village for help. The first mechanic was shut. The second one was going to take an hour to fix it. The third one was finally able to look at the bike and fix it. The valve had given away and the rubber tube inside it had to be replaced.</p>
<p>But by the time he was done it was 11:30. I had wasted almost 45 minutes because of this flat. It was pretty certain that Panchgini was out of question now. Maybe Wai, but that too was 30 kilometres away.</p>
<h3>The Beginning of the End</h3>
<p>I crossed another toll booth after Khandala and entered a one-way block of the highway. At first it was a pretty decent road &#8211; shady, well built and mostly flat. Then it began to climb again. The trees also cleared out and gave way to small bushes. And then I saw the first major mountain in my way ahead. So tall, that it made the Katraj Ghat look like a walk in the park. Also more conspicuous was the absence of any kind of human settlement for several miles around. And judging by my recent luck with the flat tyres, it seemed like a bad proposition to enter there. But there was something that kept me going &#8211; the odometer, now tantalizingly close to 80 kilometres. If I turned back and went the exact same route as I had come, I would again miss the 160 kilometres and 100 mile mark narrowly. But it seemed really foolish to go halfway into uninhabited area without any preparation.</p>
<p>While these thoughts ran through my mind, I went past a dhaba, probably the last one on this side of the ghats. I went ahead several metres before deciding to at least have a meal before moving on. It was almost 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>After a greasy paneer palak and 2 rotis I chatted up the owner about road conditions ahead. He pretty much echoed what I had estimated &#8211; uninhabited land, steep climb and rash drivers. At least there wouldn&#8217;t be any oncoming traffic as the road continued to be a one way through the ghats. He told me that since I was on a bicycle I could turn back right there itself and ride against the traffic without any worry from the highway patrols. But on pushing a bit I came to know of another route across an embankment which cut across the fields and connected this side of the highway with its corresponding road going back towards Khandala. I hopped onto my bike and pedalled towards it and hoped to reach the magic 80 kilometre figure somewhere upon this embankment.</p>
<h3>Homeward Bound</h3>
<p>This was a rough road, yet under construction. But the regular passage of heavy vehicles had flattened it out quite a bit and I was able to make it through with little trouble. The odometer meanwhile climbed painfully slowly towards 80. I reached the other end of the embankment with yet a kilometre and a half to go. Had I ridden the Bangalore-Bombay bypass, I would have completed 75 kilometres at Khandala itself, and would be easily beyond 80 kilometres by now. I cursed myself for taking the different route.</p>
<div id="attachment_216" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/embankment.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-216" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/embankment-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="embankment" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-216" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-216" class="wp-caption-text">Embankment beyond Khandala</p></div>
<p>The odometer finally ticked past the 80 kilometre figure a while later, and at least before the toll booth. I began to calculate distances in my head. By my estimates, home was around 75 kilometres from Khandala if I took the Katraj-Warje-Chandni Chowk-DRDO-Aundh route. I would have to modify it slightly, maybe even take a detour through Sanghvi before stopping at home if I was to complete 100 miles.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind I moved ahead.</p>
<h3>Misery at 100</h3>
<p>I touched 100 kilometres at 2:00 pm, with the milestones indicating 40 kilometres to Pune. This was going to be a close call for me. Unfortunately, I did not have much time to think about this issue. I got off to take a breather and a sip of water. When I noticed that the rear tyre had gone flat again. I was just ahead of Shirwal and luckily, close to a mechanic. The only consolation was that it had happened here and not 20 kilometres back where there was no help available.</p>
<div id="attachment_215" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/countryside.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-215" loading="lazy" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/countryside-175x175.jpg" alt="" title="countryside" width="175" height="175" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-215" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-215" class="wp-caption-text">The countryside on NH4</p></div>
<p>I pushed my bike into the village and outside the only &#8220;puncture dukaan&#8221; in the entire hamlet. Locals gathered around to watch this amazing bike as the old man dug out his tools and got to work. The patch from the previous puncture earlier in the morning had given away. This guy tried to peel it off but it was glued to tight. So, this is the best part, he burned it! Liberal amount of adhesive was put onto the old patch and lit up with a match. I watched with bated breath, expecting the entire tube and this guy himself to turn into Wile E. Coyote-style cinder any second. Nothing of that sort happened though, and a few seconds later he doused the flame with a wet rag. The old patch plopped off like an autumn leaf.</p>
<p>The rest of the task was easy. He patched up the tube and I was on my way again.</p>
<p>All that stopping had taken the wind out of my sails. I kept getting paranoid about new punctures and stopped to check my tyres every 20 minutes or so. This greatly affected my progress, although I managed to cover 10 kilometres in the next half-hour. I was 30 kilometres from Pune with 110 kilometres on the odometer.</p>
<h3>Desperate Times, Desperate Measures</h3>
<p>The journey was uneventful until the toll booth. My water supply was completely depleted and I munched on the last energy bar that sustained me till Joshi Wadewale on the outskirts of Pune. I refuelled myself on a masala dosa and water and did a distance check.</p>
<p>138 kilometres. 22 more to a century.</p>
<p>In a last desperate attempt, I changed the return route to go over the bypass rather than through Katraj. This would add some precious kilometres to the tally. Going through the new Katraj Tunnel was fun as usual, although the dynamo was not really built to burn at 60 km/h and blew up spectacularly as soon as I reached the other end.</p>
<p>I stopped for a while to catch my breath after the wild ride through the tunnel and to enjoy the view over the Jhambulwadi Road.</p>
<p>The road continued to slope downwards right up to Warje and the odometer ticked on furiously. At the Pashankar Showroom, it was showing 148 kilometres, with 2.5 kilometres to Baner and another 10 kilometres from there to home. This was going to be really close.</p>
<div id="attachment_214" style="width: 185px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bug.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-214" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-214" title="bug" src="http://www.notadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bug-175x175.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-214" class="wp-caption-text">Bug near Jhambulwadi</p></div>
<p>What caught my eye was the tremendous amount of spruce-up that this road had gone through since my last ride. Flags punctuated the road at regular distances, indicating the path to the sports village. The flyover at Sadanand Hotel had been completed &#8211; from a mound of rubble just two weeks ago, it had been converted into a 4-lane, tarred bridge with an underpass for the Baner to Balewadi traffic. Lights, barriers and parking areas had been set up with appropriate signages. And a strong security cover that checked every car headed towards the complex. I think I got away from security only because I resembled an athlete in training with the helmet.</p>
<h3>The Home Stretch</h3>
<p>Ami finished her work at around 6:30 and called me. Since I was going to be returning by the same route as her commute, I waited for her at along the way. The way back was easy, although traffic did eat into my waning patience.</p>
<p>I finally watched the odometer tick past the 160 kilometre mark near Spicer College, with a kilometre and a half more to spare.</p>
<p>Damn. That felt good.</p>

	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It is really amazing how fast the week has gone by. Between the daily grind and a weekend back home in Mumbai, I have not had the time to ride on my new bicycle at all. All I do is use it for my regular commute, albeit with a lot more style.</p>
<p>During the past year I had cycled enough to know exactly what kind of cycling interested me the most – a comfortable commute and some medium distance touring. After tons of research on different bicycle websites and forums, I had more or less decided on the following specifications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional geometry frame</li>
<li>Multiple gears</li>
<li>Drop bars</li>
<li>Large wheelbase</li>
<li>Narrow tires</li>
<li>Light weight</li>
<li>Mudguards and rear rack (those could be added as accessories to<br />
any bike)</li>
<li>Ability to handle the occasional untarred road</li>
</ul>
<p>Most dealers kept pushing mountain bikes or road bikes upon me. That is until I came upon the Navigator in one of the stores at Nana Peth. It seemed like a well-designed bike, although I was not sure yet if this would be the perfect one for me. For one, it was built around a compact geometry, with a sloping top tube. But given<br />
that I would be riding it mostly on my daily commute rather than touring around the country, I was willing to compromise on that point. The second drawback of the Navigator was that it had riser bars rather than the drop bars I was more interested in having.</p>
<p>After dilly-dallying for almost two months, I finally compromised and picked up the Navigator because it met most other requirements, while fitting in nicely within my budget.</p>
<h3>Looks That Kill</h3>
<p>The LA Sovereign Navigator looks good. Its silver body with black graphics makes it a sure-shot eye-catcher. I have had motorcyclists and rickshaw drivers slow down alongside with approving nods, pedestrians turn heads as I race past and<br />
colleagues congregate around it during lunch to discuss its features. In fact, it looks so pretty that it is sure to be a thief magnet. That is not to say that I have experimented with this quality of the bike. But I need to stop tempting fate and get a good U-lock for it soon. The complimentary cable lock is too short and too flimsy to hold off a determined crook.</p>
<h3>Up to Task</h3>
<p>The daily commute is not a race and the potholed roads are far from a racetrack. Although I did not realize this at first, the ideal bicycle for such conditions would let me ride with an almost upright posture, while propelling me fast enough with little<br />
effort. The Navigator meets all these requirements and more.</p>
<p>The riser bar is easy to reach, but because it only gives one grip position, I am not sure how well my hands will do on a long ride. The seat was too low during my first ride and did not allow my leg to be completely extended. Not to mention that I looked like a dork. I have now lifted the seat post up to its minimum insertion mark and it seems much better.</p>
<p>The frame is very light and easily goes several hundred metres with a single turn of the pedal once it picks up speed. In fact, it is so light that the first time I rode it, I was afraid that putting too much load in one spot would break something. I am also able to lift it up two floors to our apartment every evening without any trouble.</p>
<p>The tyres are narrow, with a patterned tread that provides good traction on all kinds of asphalt and tar surfaces. The V-brakes provide sufficient stopping power to halt those wheels in their tracks, although I have not had any need to test their full<br />
potential as yet.</p>
<p>The Shimano Tourney gears are sufficient for my purpose, although I am yet to make them go through their test of mettle. There are some adjustment problems with the gears, but because of my limited exposure to them I have deferred fiddling with them for the store mechanics instead.</p>
<h3>Finishing Touches</h3>
<p>It also comes with front and rear mudguards that run close to the wheel and cover a large arc – the best types. I have ridden in some light to medium rain and have not had any problem with the slush hitting my back. There are some dents on the front mudguard which I brought to the notice of the dealer and the customer service folks at LA Sovereign. Both have promised a replacement shortly. I might remove the mudguards after the monsoons are over to give the cycle a sleeker look as well as make it lighter.</p>
<p>The rear rack is useless as it does not have a spring clamp to hold things. I will need to carry some nylon ropes or a bungee cord, which becomes a hassle to tie and untie. The backpack is a more practical option for my short, daily ride. But I will need to consider an alternative when I go for a longer spin. Again, since I do not use it much, I have an option of removing it completely.</p>
<p>A quainter feature is the bell, not seen on most high-end bikes these days, making them dangerous while travelling amongst jaywalking pedestrians. The cycle itself barely makes a whisper. It certainly is nice to have something to draw the attention of people who inadvertently step into my path rather than slamming the brakes every few metres.</p>
<p>The most eye-catching feature of the Navigator is the dynamo-driven headlight. It is a low-powered affair, enough only to make me visible at night or in the rain. But given the frequent load shedding in Pune, any illumination is most welcome.</p>
<h3>And Finally</h3>
<p>LA Sovereign seems to have a policy to sell an experience rather than bicycles. Their customer service department has been consistently responsive, polite and honest. Even before I had finalized on which brand I would go for, their customer service team gave me honest replies about their product range, highlighting features and drawbacks of the bicycles I had short-listed.</p>
<p>Surendar Cycles, the dealer from Pune from whom I made the purchase, follows a similar philosophy. I had already done my homework so he did not have to go through a sales pitch with me. But he was the only dealer I visited who dissuaded me from converting the riser bars into drop bars, which I was rather keen<br />
upon earlier.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ami was attending a retreat with some of her work colleagues at Lonavala last Friday and Saturday. Although I was not sure what I would be doing while she was gone, I was certain that it would involve cycling.</p>
<p>Some of my colleagues had gone out to lunch on Wednesday and amongst them was good friend and fellow biker Amit (not to be confused with good wife and fellow biker Ami). He owns a Trek 4300D and regularly rides long distances on it. In the course of our conversation, one of us brought up the suggestion of a ride this weekend. Since Ami was going to be at Lonavala, we too decided to be there and surprise her.</p>
<p>Friday night I got home from visiting Surendra Cycles at Karve Road (that is another story, on another thread) and hit the sack early. We were to meet at 5:30 near my home and take the National Highway . Amit was waiting for me at 5:45 and I went down. This is where the fun began.</p>
<p>When I went down the cycle was not standing upright, as I had left it, but completely keeled over to one side, leaning against the wall. The cycle had developed a slow puncture in the rear tire from my trip the last evening. Fisssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss&#8230;</p>
<p>I was completely helpless at that point and called up Amit. He came over and we waited out at my place until the cycle store opened. Incidentally, it had occurred to me several times in the past few days to ask Amit to carry his puncture kit, but I ignored it. This was going to cramp our schedule big-time &#8211; over two hours lost.</p>
<h3>Time to go</h3>
<p>Finally, at 8-ish we pushed our cycles to the store. It took a few minutes for the patch-up to be completed and the ride was ready to roll again (Note to self: buy puncture kit). The sun was high in the sky by now. As mentioned in a previous post, the Pimpri-Chinchwad portion of the National Highway is a pleasure to ride. However, that applies only when you sweep off all other traffic and stray cattle from the road. I had three near misses with an autorickshaw, a pedestrian and a Mahindra Jeep when they broke the signal (except for the pedestrian, who was taking a leisurely stroll in the middle of the road). Once past Jai Hind Industries, up to where I had ridden the last time around, I was into virgin territory for my bicycle. From here onwards, commuter traffic began to thin out in favour of trucks.</p>
<p>On entering Dehu Road , we were into heaven, sort of &#8211; lush greenery all around, with an intermittent squatter generating&#8230;ahem&#8230;fertilizer for the plants. I had seen such views by the railway tracks in Mumbai. However, watching them answer nature&#8217;s call on a 100-foot tall hill amongst fresh grass and goats even astonished me.</p>
<h3>Halt!</h3>
<p>We had been doing good time so far &#8211; 22 kilometres an hour and we had reached so far in just under an hour and a half. I called for the first break at Dehu Road . We stopped and I got off for a few minutes to ease the cramping in my thighs. I was now beginning to push myself beyond any previous ride attempt and would soon begin to show.</p>
<p>At little while later, near Vadgaon, I realized that the Maggi that I had had for breakfast had moved over and left a gaping void in my stomach. So we stopped again and had some biscuits and plenty of water. Since we were still hungry, we rolled into the first roadside hotel that showed up and feasted on wada&#8217;s and a masala dosa. After refilling our bottles with water, we were on our way again.</p>
<p>Now is where the fun begins. All of a sudden, we were caught in a sweeping sheet of rain. However, before we had removed the rain gear from the bags and put it on, it had stopped. We left the jacket on anyways and continued onwards.</p>
<h3>Uphill</h3>
<p>I had to get off the bike at Kamshet because the slope was too steep for me to pedal the Exodus upon (what was this designer thinking when he fed it over 25 kilos of aluminium and steel?). On the other hand, Amit merrily clipped along up the hill in low gear.</p>
<p>Going downhill was much easier upon my legs and I coasted along easily until the next uphill slope before Karla. Once past this slope, the road flattened out into the distance for many kilometres. We could read the milestones counting down the distance to Lonavala &#8211; chhey, paanch, chaar, chhey&#8230;what?! Oh well, never mind. Somebody had mixed up the old and new milestones and could not be bothered to come and fix them again. After all, what&#8217;s a couple of kilometres here or there for a car. Try to explain that to a cyclist though.</p>
<h3>The Final Stretch</h3>
<p>After that, we were unmindful of the milestones. We would know we were there once we actually got there. On that note, we forged ahead full steam and shortly found ourselves mired in the traffic jams of Lonavala. It is amazing how a perfectly serene spot is vandalized by our society in the name of development. What was once an idyllic retreat for retirees has now turned into a weekend picnic spot featuring a water park, plenty of restaurants to stuff your face and unorganized traffic. It is like the Mumbaikars (yes, I am looking at you) have brought a slice of Mumbai to Lonavala and instead of gobbling it up or taking it back, have left rotting leftovers for the Lonavalaites.</p>
<p>After this point, the road was downhill, with brief humps that the momentum of our bikes would take us over. We were going so fast that I barely noticed the sign to the resort that Ami was in and screeched to a halt just in time. We entered into the lane, and after some searching, finally found the road that led to the resort.</p>
<p>The road was a sheer slope, well beyond 45 degrees, covered with slippery and evilly sharp edged rocks. Amit easily went down on the Trek, but I was completely out of my element with my road-riding configuration. I was probably violating every rule of mountain biking &#8211; no helmet, a tall seat reaching above the handlebar, slippery calliper brakes and smoother tyre treads.</p>
<p>I did the prudent thing and dismounted, then lugged the cycle down the slope.</p>
<p>I left a note at the hotel reception and sent it to Ami. The smile on her face when she came down made the entire gruelling journey worthwhile.</p>
<p>We left after lunch at the hotel, but it was already quite late. Neither one of us was in the mood to ride 70 kilometres back home, especially since we would still be on the highway by the time it was dark without any lights. So instead, we purchased luggage tickets for the bicycles and boarded the Pune local. We left Lonavala at 5:20 and were back home by 6:45.</p>
<h3>Some tips for bringing your cycle by train</h3>
<p>The ticket clerk did not have a clue about bringing bicycles by train. He told me that it was not possible. Not looking forward to riding back in the dark, I persisted and spoke to the chief ticket inspector on the station. He told me that he would be able to make a luggage ticket for me.</p>
<p>The handy-dandy-freight-fare-reference book that the Indian Railways provides to its employees was probably written when the first train chugged from Boribunder to Thane, and has never been updated since. In the absence of a weighing scale, bicycles are to be considered as weighing 40 kilograms, which is quite absurd. We would have to be descendants of Hercules to be able to push 40 kilograms of anything over 70 kilometres. We tried to reason for a bit, but it turned out to be fruitless.</p>
<p>We went onto the platform and waited for the local train to arrive. We loaded the bicycles while the compartment was still empty and found comfortable seats. Amit&#8217;s Trek was a great conversation starter with the locals.</p>
<p>I was glad when we stopped at Khadki station an hour later. One side of the platform at Khadki is reserved for military trains and hence was empty. Amit took the opportunity to live his childhood dream &#8211; riding a bicycle on a railway platform &#8211; a final bit of delight to a very enjoyable trip.</p>
<h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
<p>A non-geared bike is no match for a geared bike.</p>
<p>You can go anywhere on any reasonable bike. The condition of a bike matters less than the conditioning of the rider.</p>
<p>Going uphill on a non-geared bike builds character.</p>
<p>Going downhill on a steep slope can easily turn into a white-knuckle ride.</p>
<p>Riding a cycle lets you take in the entire road and not just visit a destination.</p>
<p>Safety is entirely your responsibility. I did not expect a single motorist to go warily around me and did my own defensive riding. Since I am not writing from a hospital bed, I can assume that this works.</p>

	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<h3>Using SVN</h3>
<p>Subversion, or svn, is a very popular version control tool, used by some of the best software teams in the world. The fact that it is free and open source, in addition to being really, really good may have something to do with that. Like most good version control tools, Subversion too is split into two components – a server and a client.</p>
<p>You don’t need to worry about the server usually because it is set up on a system far out of your reach. If you are located in North America or Europe, it means that your company has outsourced the Subversion hosting somewhere in South America or India. Funnily enough, good companies in Bangalore (or Pune) usually outsource their Subversion hosting to a really, really good outfit in LA (read, Dreamhost). Silly. But that’s how the global economy works, and which is why it is more fun to be a software developer than to be an economist.</p>
<p>Coming back to our topic&#8230;</p>
<p>What you will use on a day-to-day basis is the Subversion command-line client (or TortoiseSVN, a GUI replacement).</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This article touches briefly upon how to get started with the client, without worrying about details. If you are a svn alpha-geek who dreams about hosting your own repository someday or whatever else you svn alpha-geeks dream about, and find my guide to be incomplete, don’t email me to write about the 10,542 variations in syntax that the svn client allows. I know you adore your svn client. But this article is targeted at people who don’t as much as <em>know</em> about svn, much less adore it.</p>
<p>Once the client is installed, you can launch a command prompt session by typing cmd into the Run dialog box in Windows and hitting enter. Once on the command prompt, type the following and hit enter.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\svn help</pre>
<p>Detailed help is also available for some of the more oft-used commands by modifying the help command like so –</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\svn help import</pre>
<h3>Import</h3>
<p>You can use the import command to <strong>add files from your computer into the repository for the first time</strong>, and hence, begin versioning them.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\svn import trunk/ file:///F:/projects/notadesigner/trunk/web/index.htm -m “Initial import”</pre>
<h3>Checkout</h3>
<p>If you are a new developer on a team that has been using Subversion for a while, you can use the checkout command <strong>to retrieve the source code from the repository onto your hard drive</strong>.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\cd projects\notadesigner\trunk
C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn checkout https://notadesigner.com/svn/trunk</pre>
<p>Note how the active directory is first changed to the path where the files have to be stored, and then the checkout command is called.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also specify the path to the working folder as a parameter to the checkout command.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\svn checkout https://notadesigner.com/svn/trunk C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk</pre>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>This is probably the next most used command in the Subversion client. Millions of developers across the globe run this command every morning to retrieve the latest version of files from the repository into their working folder. Running this command makes sure that you are running abreast of everyone else on your team, by bringing the latest changes they have committed to the repository onto your machine (and likewise, your latest changes get updated on their machines).</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn update</pre>
<p>Like true Zen, it is a deceptively simple command. Just two words that do you a whole lot of good.</p>
<h3>Add / Delete</h3>
<p>These commands do just what they say. They make changes to your working copy, and schedule the same change to the repository when you commit your changes later.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn add locations.htm
C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn delete directions.htm
C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn commit –m “Added new locations. Deleted directions because we’re spread all over the city and I didn’t know where to send them.”</pre>
<h3>Copy / Move</h3>
<p>Copy and move work exactly as they do on your operating system, except that they are targeted at the repository.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn copy jobs.htm https://notadesigner.com/svn/trunk -m “Adding new jobs page”</pre>
<p>Move requires a separate commit to implement your changes into the repository.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn move jobs.htm jobs/index.htm
C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn commit –m “Moved jobs page into separate folder”</pre>
<h3>Revert</h3>
<p>This command rolls back any changes made to a file in your working folder, and restores it to the version on the repository.</p>
<pre lang="dos">C:\projects\notadesigner\trunk\web&gt;svn revert contact.htm</pre>
<h3>Using TortoiseSVN</h3>
<p>TortoiseSVN lets you perform all actions that the svn command-line client lets you, without messing with the command-line. If you are new to Subversion, it’s a compelling replacement to the regular svn client.</p>
<h3>Finally, DON’T Do This</h3>
<p>I have found a shockingly large number of people doing silly things while using a VCS. I am tired of telling them not to do it and so if you abuse a VCS in any of the following ways and I catch you at it, I’ll make you write this list on a blackboard that screeches, for at least a week&#8230;without ear muffs.</p>
<p>It’s not that difficult to avoid them. So listen up.</p>
<h4>DON’T make a copy of your working folder to make edits</h4>
<p>If you are checking out files from the repository in a working folder and then making a copy of that folder to make edits because you don’t want to overwrite your old files, you’re plain crazy and haven’t understood the most basic premise of version control.</p>
<p>The repository already has a copy of your files which compile correctly. If you make a mistake, revert your files and you’re back where you began from.</p>
<h4>DON’T make a copy of your folder in the repository before editing your files</h4>
<p>A more severe case of the previous symptom is when a developer copies the entire trunk in the repository into trunk-2 (effectively creating a branch) and making edits to that.</p>
<p>If you are still unable to understand how the trunk is managed, branching is definitely out of bounds for you. Get back in line.</p>
<h4>DON’T delete old files from the repository before adding the edited working copy</h4>
<p>The whole point of version control is to have a history of your file over time. If you delete the file from your repository, you destroy that history. If you do it every time, somebody who looks at your file six months down the line will have no idea about the pedigree of your file, the bugs that have been fixed or the new code that has been added to it.</p>
<h4>DON’T forget to add comments when committing changes</h4>
<p>You’ve got to be really lazy to not add comments at the time of committing your changes. Vague comments such as “updated file” are just as useless.</p>
<p>It helps to be descriptive in the changelog because that’s the first place people go to find out what’s been cooking in your files. If you don’t tell them up front what you’ve been up to, they’ll just think that you’ve been messing up and saddle you with all the blame.</p>
<h4>DON’T forget to add new files to the repository</h4>
<p>This is a common mistake and can happen by even the most seasoned developers. But I’m writing it here to simply reinforce it that this should be avoided.</p>

<p>If you find this article doesn’t quite quench your thirst about version control systems or Subversion, you can learn more stuff by visiting the following websites.</p>

&#8211; Colloquially referred to as the svn-book, this is the granddaddy of all Subversion books. Contains detailed explanations about the history of svn, repository and server setup and administration, detailed explanations about the acrobatic feats that the client lets you do, and if you’re really interested, a description of the C API’s that let you hook up svn with your own applications.</p>
