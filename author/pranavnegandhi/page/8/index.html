		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In our rush to Web 2.0 our lives, we seem to have forgotten to imbibe the essentials. Everyone is guilty of that – from fruit farmers using artificial fertilizer, to politicians driving nations to war, to developers not using version control.</p>
<p>Shocking, really.</p>
<p>I do not have much pull with the fruit farmers or international diplomats. But as a fellow developer, it’s my duty to bring back the lost software teams of today into the fold. Forget ‘enterprisey architectures’ for a while and look at the basics. In this article I will introduce you to the wholesome goodness of Subversion, a fantastic version control tool.</p>
<h3>Essentially Missing</h3>
<p>Version control is an essential tool in any software team’s kit. In spite of that, I regularly run into senior developers with years of experience who have never used it. Which is, to be honest, quite frustrating because then their working directory tends to look like this –</p>
<p>Product-latest</p>
<p>Prodcut-new-12-march (yes, it is misspelled)</p>
<p>Product-new-mar-15</p>
<p>&#8230;<a title="The Best-est Version Control" href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The_Best-est_Version_Control.aspx">and the disaster repeats till eternity</a>.</p>
<p>If you notice, this directory structure is already functions as a basic version control repository, in that it separates successive updates to the product, but without all the extra goodies that a true version control tool would let you have such as comments, labels and developer history.</p>
<h3>Towards the Light</h3>
<p>Whenever I have had the good fortune of introducing developers to version control – even with rogue tools like Visual SourceSafe – they knew this was the elixir they were missing for so long. It takes some work to actually drive it into their system. But once there, it stays on forever.</p>
<p>The single biggest advantage all of them cite is how easy it becomes to <strong>synchronize files between team members</strong>. Because everybody is updating their files every morning from the same location, it becomes easier to keep abreast with everyone’s changes.</p>
<p>The next biggest advantage is <strong>the ability to roll back mistakes</strong>. If a file has not been checked in, simply revert it back and the VCS replaces it with the latest one in the repository. Even after the file has been checked in, a previous version of the file can be retrieved from the repository and used to restore the changes made.</p>
<p>A side-effect of this feature is the ability to <strong>sandbox major changes</strong>. Rewriting core algorithms of your accounting product using that new design patterns book? (Hah!) Do it in a local working copy, test it and then <s>throw it away when you discover you suck at patterns</s> check it in after it works fine.</p>
<p>As a project’s requirements evolve, files mutate into completely different beasts from their initial incarnation. By logging a note about each change made to the file in the VCS, developers are able to <strong>track the project history</strong> in the long term.</p>
<p>Another nice feature of the tracking tools is that they help <strong>assign ownership</strong> by logging the person who has made a change. This proves to be quite helpful when giving credit, or more frequently, blamestorming.</p>
<p>And the greatest relief that a VCS provides to all stakeholders is the <strong>daily backup that occurs</strong> <strong>automatically </strong>when developers check-out the latest changes every morning. It’s rare for a team using VCS to lose a lot of data due to hard drive failures.</p>
<h3>The VCS Dictionary</h3>
<p>Let’s begin with learning the terminology used when dealing with version control.</p>
<h4>Parts of a VCS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Repository: The database storing the files. The repository is usually expected to be on a central location such as a network server, although it can exist on locally stored directories.</li>
<li>Server: The computer storing the repository. If the repository is stored on a directory on your own computer, then your computer is called the server although there is no network access involved.</li>
<li>Client: The computer connecting to the repository. Your computer.</li>
<li>Working Set/Working Copy: Your local directory of files, where you make changes.</li>
<li>Trunk/Main: The primary location for code in the repository. This is the in-progress version of code, with untested or partially implemented features. Feature-complete snapshots are stored in a branch folder.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Common Terms</h4>
<ul>
<li>Revision: What version a file is on (v1, v2, v3, etc.).</li>
<li>Head: The latest revision in the repository.</li>
<li>Commit Message: A short message entered at the time of committing a file, describing what was changed.</li>
<li>Changelog/History: A list of changes made to a file since it was created.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Basic Actions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add: Put a file into the repository for the first time.</li>
<li>Check-out: Download a file from the repository.</li>
<li>Commit/Check-in: Upload a file to the repository. The file gets a new revision number, and people can “check out” the latest one.</li>
<li>Update/Sync: Synchronize your files with the latest from the repository. This lets you grab the latest revisions of all files. Do this at least once a day.</li>
<li>Revert: Throw away your local changes and return to the latest version from the repository.</li>
<li>Diff/Change/Delta: Finding the differences between two files. Useful for seeing what changed between revisions. This only works on text files (e.g. .as, .htm, .cs). Binary files (e.g. .psd, .fla, .doc) cannot be diffed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Advanced Actions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Branch: Create a separate copy of a file/folder for private use (bug fixing, testing, etc). Branch is both a verb (”branch the code”) and a noun (”Which branch is it in?”).</li>
<li>Merge: Apply the changes from one file to another, to bring it up-to-date. For example, you can merge features from one branch into another.</li>
<li>Conflict: Occurs when two people edit the same file simultaneously. The first person to edit the file does not face any error. However, the file on the server is now out of sync with the file on the second person’s working folder. When he attempts to commit the file to the repository he gets a conflict.
<p>Conflicts can be resolved for text files by manually selecting which lines of code to keep and which ones to discard.</p>
<p>There is no way to resolve binary files. If there is a conflict in binary files, then the second person has to begin again by retrieving the latest file, and re-creating the changes made to it before the conflict occurred.</p>
<p>To avoid conflicts on binary files, a user can lock the file before editing.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Resolve: Fixing the changes that contradict each other and checking in the correct version.</li>
<li>Locking: Flagging a file for exclusive use until it is committed again.</li>
<li>Breaking the lock: Forcibly unlocking a file so you can edit it. It may be needed if someone locks a file and goes on vacation (or “calls in sick” the day Halo 3 comes out).</li>
</ul>
<h3>An Illustrated Example</h3>
<p>Pop Candy is a Java developer who has just joined the team at Timeless Software. Her task is to <a title="Zawinski's Law" href="http://www.iwar.org.uk/hackers/resources/faq/jargon.htm#Zawinski's%20Law">add an email client to their product</a>. She <strong>creates a folder on her hard drive</strong> for the project, and proceeds to <strong>check out the files from the repository</strong>.</p>
<p>Once she has the entire product code check out onto her hard drive, she compiles it and familiarizes herself with its features.</p>
<p>Once she’s ready, and <a title="Painless Functional Specifications - Why Bother?" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html">has read the spec</a>, she begins editing the first file. She adds a few more files to the project, compiles and tests. Makes a few changes, goes back and compiles and tests, and in no time at all, she has reached her first milestone. Her email client connects to the server and successfully <a title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Sample" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol#Sample_communications">handles the server’s response to HELO</a>.</p>
<p>She feels she’s achieved quite a bit for the day and proceeds to add her changes to the repository. The first step is to <strong>select the new files</strong> she’s created and <strong>adding them to the repository</strong>. Then, she selects the new files, and the ones she’s modified and <strong>commits them </strong>all in a single operation. She remembers to <strong>enter a log comment</strong> that describes the change clearly. When the other developers come in the next day and <strong>update their working copies</strong>, they’ll see that Candy has begun working on the email client.</p>
<p>The next day Candy is working on adding a rich text editor into the email client. She uses an off-the-shelf JavaScript library to do the job to save time. Smart!</p>
<p>But when her team lead reviews it, he points out to her that the terms of license of this library conflict with those of their commercial product. Candy is grumpy because it took an entire day to integrate the editor. It was her fault, though. The spec clearly stated that no off-the-shelf library is to be used. So she has to go back and undo her changes. She <strong>deletes all the unversioned files</strong> in the project folder and proceeds to <strong>revert the edited files</strong> to their head version.</p>
<p>A few days into development, as the email client begins adding bulk, the testers complain that the product itself seems to be very sluggish. Everybody scrambles to get their hands on <strong>the changelog</strong> on the date since when the testers noticed the slowdown.</p>
<p>All fingers are pointed at Candy’s code for the moment, but the team lead defers any decision until he’s actually reviewed her commits on that particular day. He retrieves the files of the previous revision and runs them through the tests. On a whim, he decides to replace their in-house SMTP test server with the live email server.</p>
<p>Luckily, it turns out that it was their testing SMTP server which was misbehaving. Instead of closing the connections on receiving QUIT, it continued to hold them. And the testers were the only ones to notice this because they sent the client through a gruelling 1,000,000 rounds of sending and receiving email.</p>
<p>You now see how easy it is to manipulate readers into seeing from your viewpoint with a contrived example veiling your actual agenda.</p>
<p>Oops!</p>
<p>No, that’s not what I meant. The moral of this story is that it is always a good idea to use version control. Version control is mother’s love and apple pie. It is the cat’s whiskers and the bee’s knees. And you just gotta have it!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have recently moved to a smaller city that can’t quite boast of the public transport system that Mumbai provides to its citizens. It does exist on paper, and when you go out you do have the option of trying to locate a public utility bus or train. But that task is so difficult that most people cave in to the temptation of flagging an auto rickshaw. Even if it costs up to ten times the price of a bus.</p>
<p>Which brings us to another problem that the people of Mumbai never have to face &#8211; auto rickshaw drivers often quote a fixed price to take you to your destination. That figure doesn’t always correspond to what the meter might have indicated had it been used. So you can either yield to their demands while feeling frustrated at being robbed in broad daylight, or haggle with them to bring them down to what you might consider a fair price. And if you don’t like haggling too much, the experience isn’t going to be very pleasant.</p>
<p>I spent the afternoon haggling with some rather brilliant code, trying to coax it to work as it was advertised it would. I’m documenting the efforts I went through out here so that I can reduce some of the agony the next time I have to do this.</p>
<h3>A Brief Background</h3>
<p>Developers and software managers everywhere laud the power and elegance of the Apache, MySQL and PHP stack. Several commercial outfits have built their entire business model around them. I have been going through the ritual of installing these three on Windows for a long time now and yet, I stumble every time I try to integrate them.</p>
<p>Installing Apache is a cinch. The developers have packaged it into a very nice installer that sets it up on your system within minutes. The default settings are fine enough for almost anybody who does not want to play system administrator. And you don’t even need to restart your system in most cases.</p>
<p>Integrating PHP on top of Apache used to be a bit of a task, but lately it’s been becoming easier. I had to add 3 lines to the Apache httpd.conf file to get it to work. There is a huge dependency on the PHP initialization file, php.ini, but the risk is reduced because the default settings in that file too are sufficient for a typical developer machine.</p>
<p>MySQL too comes with its own installer that takes away most of the pain from the setup process.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>But this is where the ease of use disappears. Making MySQL work with the Apache and PHP stack always seems to be a pain. Since I don’t do this very often, I can’t remember the integration recipe very well. I’m usually not even sure if I faced the same problems the last time around &#8211; much less the resolution.</p>
<p>This article is a guideline for me to follow the next time I have to go through installing these applications. The problem I faced and its resolution is still fresh in my mind since I only stepped through it this afternoon.</p>
<p>It all started when I attempted to load the php_mysqli.dll extension to integrate MySQL into the stack. For extensions to load, PHP needs to be given the path to the folder where the .dll files are stored. The default location is the “ext” folder under the PHP root folder. This path is defined in the variable “extensions_dir” in php.ini.</p>
<p>For some reason the path was not interpreted correctly by PHP on start-up. The Apache error log kept showing the following error &#8211;</p>
<p style="background: #ffff99; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #000;">PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library &#8216;E:\\apps\\php-5.2.3\\ext\\php_mysqli.dll&#8217; &#8211; The specified module could not be found.\r\n in Unknown on line 0</p>
<p>The double backslashes in the path baffled me because the value in php.ini was definitely not typed that way. It is a common convention to escape certain characters by placing the backslash before it, so I felt that this was mangling the path.</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>I searched the web and found that many people have faced this issue. The solutions proposed were varied.</p>
<p>Some suggested that the library file libmysql.dll bundled with PHP 5.2.3 was buggy. I replaced it with the recommended earlier version (from PHP 5.2.1) but the error still persisted. Others suggested that the extensions that were needed could be moved to the System32 folder, so that they would be found by the PATH system variable. But I refused to corrupt my OS folders with such unnecessary files.</p>
<p>The obvious other solution was to add the extensions folder to my system path, which I duly did. But to my surprise the extension still didn’t load. I checked and rechecked that the folder was included in the system path.</p>
<p>By chance I happened to run a script in my browser that called the phpinfo() function. Browsing through the values, I came upon the Apache Environment section that described how Apache interacted within the OS. And that’s where I found the problem. For some reason, even after a restarting the service, Apache continued to maintain the old system variables in its memory. Because of this, PHP didn’t know where to search for extensions and kept returning the same error.</p>
<p>Restarting Windows solved the problem.</p>
<p>I still haven’t figured out why the “extensions_dir” variable doesn’t work as expected. I have tried various combinations of front- and backslashes, besides experimenting with several relative and absolute path names without any luck. Backslashes are always escaped in the error log, although front slashes are left as-is.</p>
<p>In all, I learnt that restarting your machine does often solve problems &#8211; not through magic but through simply realigning different portions of memory that may be connected in some obscure manner. Not bad for an afternoon.</p>
<h3>WAMP Installation Checklist</h3>
<p>For the benefit of those struggling with the kind of problems I faced, here’s the complete checklist to follow when installing the AMP stack on Windows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Apache</li>
<li>Download the PHP archive and unzip into a folder of your choice</li>
<li>Add the following line to httpd.conf depending upon the version of Apache installed -LoadModule php5_module &#8220;E:/apps/php-5.2.3/php5apache2.dll&#8221;<br />
or<br />

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In <a title="Keeping Count I – The Candy Shop" href="http://www.notadesigner.com/keeping-count-i-the-candy-shop/">my previous post</a> I described Daryl’s experience as a programmer writing an inventory control system for a candy store. Over the next few weeks Betty, the store owner, spread the word about Daryl’s fantastic inventory and billing management software amongst her friends. Daryl was flooded with requests for a computer application “just like the Betty’s”.</p>
<p>So he got down to work again. But Daryl now felt that writing inventory control wasn’t as much fun any more. So he wanted to get away with as little code, in the shortest amount of time as possible. He looked at what he had written for Betty and realised that most of the core inventory code was supposed to work exactly the same. All that was needed was to detail out some business specific stuff such as sale-units. This code could go into a thin layer on top of the code inventory module.</p>
<p>This is what his base Inventory class looks like.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">class Inventory
{
    function AddUnits(Units:Number)
    {
        m_units += Units;
    }

    function RemoveUnits(Units:Number)
    {
        m_units -= Units;
    }

    function PrintUnits()
    {
        print(“Remaining units: ” + m_units);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Daryl adds a member variable called FunctionReference and a method called SetUnitConvertor() to this class, which accepts a function reference as a parameter.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">function SetUnitConvertor(ObjectReference:Object, FunctionReference:Function)
{
    m_unitConvertor = Delegate.create(ObjectReference, FunctionReference)
}</pre>
<p>Then he modifies the PrintUnits() method to use this function reference.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">function PrintUnits()
{
    print(“Remaining units: ” + m_unitConvertor(m_units));
}</pre>
<p>He copies the Inventory class into the project for Mr. Coton’s cloth store and adds a class specific to that store inheriting from the Inventory class.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">class ClothStoreInventory extends Inventory
{
    function ClothStoreInventory()
    {
        super.SetUnitConvertor(this, ConvertUnitsToLength);
    }

    function ConvertUnitsToLength(Units:Number)
    {
        // Find the total length of cloth sold
        return Units / 1000
    }
}</pre>
<p>And another class is added for Mr. Chiseller’s consultancy firm.</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">class ConsultancyFirmInventory extends Inventory
{
    function ConvertUnitsToTime(Units:Number)
    {
        // Show the number of hours worked
        Seconds = Math.floor(Units / 1000);
        Minutes = Math.floor(Seconds / 60);
        Seconds = Seconds % 60;
        Hours = Math.floor(Minutes / 60);
        Minutes = Minutes % 60;
        return Hours + “:” + Minutes + “:” + Seconds;
    }
}</pre>
<p>The result of this hoopla is that the base class will always call the formatting function from its inherited class (which would be quite impossible otherwise without using a messy callback system, or hard-coding the object reference into the base class, or (gasp!) event generation.</p>
<p>“But why use a delegate, you silly goose! The base class can override the PrintUnits() method with whatever it wants to use in its place.”</p>
<p>Well, that’s true. But when you start overriding methods from the base class, it means that the base class has not been designed to anticipate future use. This is a very basic example. But if your PrintUnits() method becomes more elaborate, such as drawing a dialog box with icons and buttons, or maybe even handling multiple output devices such as printers and LCD tickers, replicating all that code in an inherited class is really bad design. By using a delegate, you also allow yourself room to use static utility classes for mundane functions such as this.</p>

		<p>Its been quite a while since I wrote about a serious programming-specific problem. In this two part series I will show you a popular database normalization method (don’t touch another database until you don’t grok that), and an alternative use for delegates. All code is written in Flash ActionScript and is purely illustrative.</p>
<p>Betty Green runs a candy shop that is wildly popular with the neighbourhood kids. The sweets she sells are sold by weight or by piece, depending upon the type. For example, peppermints are sold by weight, while chocolate bars are sold by the number of bars purchased. Being a good manager, Betty also keeps a register to track the amount of items of each type that she’s sold. At the end of the day she totals up the register and updates her inventory for the next day.</p>
<p>The system itself is quite good, but Betty would prefer that she didn’t have to wait till the end of the day to check out on which items she’s running low on, because then it means that her supplier can be notified only the next day. If she could let him know sooner, then she could stock up again on the same day and not lose customers.</p>
<p>Betty has received a new computer on her birthday from her aunt, which she feels can be used to good effect in her store. Daryl, a friend of hers, is a computer geek of sorts who has offered to write a software application for her billing and inventory management. He offers her many snazzy features such as automatic SMS order placement to her supplier when inventory falls low, a digital gallery of candies that she can display on an LCD ticker outside her store and of course, email. But what really gets her attention is a boring feature called inventory management. That is, the computer keeps track of her inventory and can give her updates after every sale, which allows her to place orders immediately if stock runs low.</p>
<p>So Daryl gets down to work. One thing that keeps nagging him is that inventory is to be maintained in two different units &#8211; grams and number of items. In her book-register, Betty used to draw two columns &#8211; one for weight and one for pieces. Whenever a sale was made, she’d fill in the appropriate column based upon the type of sweet she sold. Now, why should the database care how she sells her sweets? That is something that only Betty needs to know when she makes inventory. Daryl designs his database with a single UnitsSold column, in which he stores the number of units of each sale. His application interprets the sale units depending upon the type of sweet and displays the value with the appropriate unit symbols.</p>
<p>This is a simple illustration of an extremely powerful concept in data processing. All data are eventually converted to integers for the processor to work upon. By understanding how those numbers are encoded for abstract data types, you not only understand what’s going on behind the scenes, you can also drop down into the primitive level to perform operations that are not supported on abstract data types. For example, bitwise operators will balk at strings, but will gladly accept integers.</p>
<p>Programmers at Learnet, where I worked some years back, never quite understood this. So their assessment tracking database for fifty different activities would contain fifty columns, some of which contained numeric values, some floating point, some Boolean and some time. If new activities had to be added, they would add another column to the table and replace the database files. Everything looked okay until someone logged in the next time after the update and found that their previous scores were all gone. Whoops!</p>
<p>In my next article I’ll explain how multiple data types can be parsed efficiently at runtime, without rewriting too much code. Stay tuned.</p>

		<p>When I first jumped into programming in ActionScript about a year ago, I was carrying a lot of baggage with me from 6 years of Director/Lingo development. I was expecting more than just a change in syntax &#8211; this was going to be a paradigm shift for me! From coding in a language that comes close to writing a sentence, to something that resembled a <strong>real</strong> programming language. Heck, it even had {}&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Thing&#8217;s didn&#8217;t go as smoothly as I had expected though. This was nothing like what I had expected or was used to. Code in separate text files? What in heavens name are classpaths? And why does this language have an overdose of ;&#8217;s? Being on a tight schedule didn&#8217;t help much. I threw in the towel, hacked together something using old school techniques, and just about threw out Flash from my arsenal.</p>
<p>But an opportunity presented itself to give a second shot at Flash. <a title="NPAPL.com" href="http://www.npapl.com" target="_blank">NPAPL</a> contracted their website redesign to Fractal Ink and an important aspect of the project was their portfolio. Since they wanted a lot of glitz into the presentation, this task would generally have been assigned to the designers. But due to the immense volume of data involved (100+ projects), I figured that a data-driven solution would make more sense than having the design team churn out a multi-megabyte, timeline driven file.</p>
<p>So I got to work digging up tutorials on component development, database access and XML parsing. Since the site was being hosted on a Windows server meant that my PHP skills would be of limited help (we ended up using static XML files instead). But the Flash code was pristine. I had finally broken through the glass ceiling.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember the instant at which the change came through. But even today as I look upon the code, it looks nice. Simple, easy, readable. It took less than a few seconds to understand how it all fits together. What I remember thinking at that time was &#8220;How will I do this in Director&#8221;. By abstracting my thoughts out of the unfamiliar syntax of ActionScript, I was able to work my way around the requirements and atleast devise a solution. What remained was a very simple translation exercise, which got underway with ease.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve moved on a lot since then today. I&#8217;m not a Flash guru or anything. But then I&#8217;d rather not be stuck working in a single environment day-in day-out. The new world of the interweb is rich in technologies, and I&#8217;m going to taste them all.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve spoken to several people since July 11 and can’t help notice the anguish that creeps through their voice when they speak about our government’s inability to stop terror strikes on our soil. Why is it that the largest democracy, heralded as a world power by many, isn&#8217;t able to protect its citizens? When the United States was attacked in 2001, President Bush came down hard upon the terrorist organisations and the nations which were <em>suspected</em> to harbour them &#8211; to the point of launching a full scale war in coalition with some of the strongest armies in the world. Why then can’t India perform such a feat against a country that it knows is responsible for several terror attacks in the past?</p>
<p>Our search for the answer begins on the premise that that the minority community feels insecure in India which political parties look to exploit.</p>
<p>Over the years I have seen the BJP and Shiv Sena combine champion the Hindutva cause. L. K. Advani has openly incited Hindus to bring down the Babri Masjid. Bal Thackarey used Saamna to encourage his party workers to launch offensives on Muslims during the riots of 1992-93. And in spite of the findings of the Sri Krishna Commission, the perpetrators of this violence are going scot-free. In such a situation, the insecurity that the community feels is not unfounded.</p>
<p>The problem is further aggravated by more politicians, who portray themselves as benefactors of the downtrodden. Parallels are drawn between the Hindus in Pakistan with the Muslims in India. The message that Muslim youth receive is that India is not their home and any act of violence that they help perpetrate upon its citizens will show their loyalty to their own motherland. Enter the LeT or Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, and their steady supply of weapons, explosives and training camps. These organisations fuel their terror operations on this sentiment.</p>
<p>In this vitriolic political scenario we bring in a government composed of a rickety coalition of parties with conflicting ideology. The Opposition is looking for every opportunity to criticize the ruling coalition and bring its government to a grinding halt &#8211; the country be damned, we want our seats back. And we expect this government to lead the country into an offensive war? Against a country which a sizable segment of the population considers their true homeland? That is wishful thinking at best and ridiculous misunderstanding of the political situation of India at worst.</p>
<p>All I can say to conclude is that India will never launch a war on terrorism unless its citizens unite in their opinion of what they call their homeland. And the power to do that lies with the citizens themselves.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Always treat your communal neighbours the way you would want to be treated.</li>
<li>Boycott media mouthpieces which carry a communal twist to their reporting.</li>
<li>Speak up against wrongdoings by politicians, whether they are against the majority or minority community.</li>
<li>Teach your children about the equality of religions and communities at an early age.</li>
<li>Never violate human rights in an attempt to seek justice for wrongdoings.</li>

	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In an unprecedented move, that could have far reaching consequences on the country’s ornithological populace, the Balasaheb Thackarey led Shiv Sena has officially banned birds from entering the country’s financial capital, Mumbai. Shiv Sena spokespersons say it is an unfortunate step, but is required in order to maintain the dignity of statues and busts scattered throughout the city. Earlier, birds would use these statues as resting points, and defecate upon them. Post this ban, statues will finally be able to heave a sigh of relief for not being mistreated in such a manner. Shiv Sena leader Udhav Thackarey says, “Imagine how you would feel if a bird came and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>shat</strong></em></span> upon your brand new outfit? Such is the condition of statues in the city many of which are being subjected to such rude treatment within hours of dedication.”</p>
<p>When asked how the ban will be implemented given the communication barriers between humans and their feathered friends, several creative ideas have been put forth by party members &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li>Installation of a fine wire net over the entire city with entrance/exit points for non-feathered creatures</li>
<li>Satellite monitoring of the city’s precincts, along with James Bond-style satellite mounted laser’s to pinpoint and annihilate offending birds</li>
<li>Worldwide extermination of birds (a bit difficult to implement given that Shiv Sena’s jurisdiction extends only within Dadar)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sena leaders have promised their cadres to lay these plans before the state government and demand implementation at the earliest.</p>
<p>In related news, noted animal activist Maneka Gandhi has raised her voice firmly against the Sena stand. Joining hands with her are hard line animal rights organisations AHIMSA and PETA. Although details of their plan of action haven’t been revealed yet, spokespersons for both organisations say their plans will take flight soon.</p>

		<p>Daryl is a programmer. He works at a small ISV, writing web based applications and online games. Daryl is also a very good communicator and has a fair amount of graphic design skills in Photoshop. Because of his communication skills Daryl&#8217;s boss entrusts him with writing the specs of any new project. He&#8217;s doing a fairly good job at it too, and is looking forward to a good review at the end of the year.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a glitch.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s a wee little company, Daryl&#8217;s boss has very little leverage before his much larger clients and strategic partners. Often, they have to take up boring maintenance or debugging tasks on a codebase that only the most insane minds would be capable of writing. Life sucks. But they hang on with a brave face. Daryl keeps at it because he knows his boss is really nice at heart and understands that he doesn&#8217;t have much say in the matter. His boss doesn&#8217;t mind because these projects keep the cash inflow coming, without which he&#8217;d never be able to hand out that hefty paycheck to Daryl at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Now one fine day his boss lands up with a really exciting project to develop a game for a large publisher. Daryl is really excited about the entire affair and dives into it with gusto. Being a sane, level headed developer, he begins with the specifications. Whirrrrrr&#8230;buzzzzz&#8230;clank&#8230;clank&#8230;bling! Dust flies, sparks shoot and the racket is just about to get on everyone&#8217;s nerves when Daryl stops and hands out a pristine 20 page document in Adobe PDF format. It&#8217;s a gem of a specification and everyone&#8217;s really excited about it.</p>
<p>His boss negotiates the terms, the schedule is fixed (of course Daryl has a say in what will be developed when), and work begins.</p>
<p>Daryl is a little worried because he&#8217;s using a new technology called Gleam, that&#8217;s supposed to be the hottest thing in online gaming since GUI&#8217;s. But because its a fairly popular technology, he&#8217;s sure to find a lot of help from forums and websites. And he begins coding.</p>
<p>On day one things are fine. On day two, Daryl&#8217;s boss comes in looking very harried. They&#8217;ve just been arm-twisted into working on a tiny maintenance project by one of their partners, Extravagance Software. Okkkkk&#8230;Daryl says to himself. I think I&#8217;ll put this game that I&#8217;m working on aside for a bit and quickly finish off this maintenance task. It&#8217;ll mean a day lost, but I&#8217;ll catch up with it by putting in a weekend. Or so he thinks.</p>
<p>The day ends and he somehow manages to patch the code from hell that he&#8217;s had to maintain. Some of the fixes work but there are others where things are not so good. And more bugs come up during further QA. Daryl, blissfully unaware about this, comes in to work the next day and is just about to get back to his game when the manager from Extravagance shows up outside his office. He&#8217;s tearing his hair out, and screaming obscenities at the client, his &#8216;stupid&#8217; coders, and pleads before Daryl on bended knee. Daryl looks at his boss, who shrugs back at him. So Daryl puts his work aside again and spends another day fixing someone else&#8217;s code instead of writing his own.</p>
<p>&#8230;and the next day, the story repeats.</p>
<p>Daryl is about to lose his patience, but feels he owes his company enough commitment to do what is required for the moment rather than crib about how boring a maintenance task is. But how far should he go? Does he have to continue slaving over this at the cost of his own project? Does his boss have to continue to let him do that?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve spent enough time at companies, both small and large, to have been on both sides of this very real issue. Larger organisations often have enough financial and strategic muscle to control the smaller service vendors. Smaller outfits have often enough been in dire straits to have to constantly worry about keeping up the cash inflow. A level headed developer will usually end up unscathed through his entire match, and maybe even learn to accept it as a way of life. But if somebody can find a solution, it&#8217;ll mean a breath of fresh air for ISV&#8217;s and encourage more people to start one.</p>
